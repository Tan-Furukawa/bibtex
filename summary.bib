@article{10.1063,
	abstract = {{Two schemes for the numerical solution of the Navier‐Stokes equations at moderate Reynolds number are discussed. The essential ingredient of the present methods is the use of the fast Fourier transform. In one scheme, discrete Fourier transformation is used to compute the convolution sums appearing in the formally Fourier‐transformed Navier‐Stokes equations. This results in an aliasing‐free, energetically conservative (when ν = 0) scheme that can be used convincingly as a model on which to test turbulence theories. The second scheme calculates in real space. Fast Fourier transform is used to solve Poisson's equation for the pressure. The latter scheme offers the advantages of speed and flexibility. The schemes are critically compared and a survey of applications is made.}},

@article{WANG20137591,
	abstract = {An efficient numerical algorithm based on a Fourier spectral iterative perturbation method is proposed to accurately compute the electrostatic fields in three-dimensional (3D) microstructures with arbitrary dielectric inhomogeneity and anisotropy. The method can be conveniently implemented in phase field modeling of microstructure evolution in systems with inhomogeneous dielectric constants as well as inhomogeneous polarization and charge distributions. It is employed to determine the temperature--shape (aspect ratio) phase diagram, domain structures, and domain switching of PbTiO3 nanoparticles using phase field simulations. It is shown that the Curie temperature is enhanced for nanowires and nanorods and reduced for nanodots. The critical sizes below which the ferroelectricity disappears for the nanowire and thin film are estimated to be around 1.4nm. Vortex domain structures are found in nanorods, nanodots, and nanodisks. Results are in general agreement with existing experimental observations and first principle calculations.},

@article{HU20011879,
	abstract = {An efficient phase-field model is proposed to study the coherent microstructure evolution in elastically anisotropic systems with significant elastic modulus inhomogeneity. It combines an iterative approach for obtaining the elastic displacement fields and a semi-implicit Fourier--spectral method for solving the time-dependent Cahn--Hilliard equation. Each iteration in our iterative numerical simulation has a one-to-one correspondence to a given order of approximation in Khachatuyran's perturbation method. A unique feature of this approach is its ability to control the accuracy by choosing the appropriate order of approximation. We examine shape dependence of isolated particles as well as the morphological dependence of a phase-separated multi-particle system on the degree of elastic inhomogeneity in elastically anisotropic systems. It is shown that although prior calculations using first-order approximations correctly predicted the qualitative dependence of a two-phase morphology on elastic inhomogeneity, the local stress distributions and thus the driving force for microstructure evolution such as coarsening were in serious error quantitatively for systems with strong elastic inhomogeneity.},

The calculations are simplified immensely, and ensuing physical analyses are well prepared for, once the structure of every algebra is unravelled completely in terms of a number of separate subalgebras isomorphic to familiar algebras such as the binary one of the complex numbers, the quaternary one of the 2 x 2 matrices and the octonary one of the complex quaternions. The fourth-rank tensors do not seem to have been submitted previously to the present algebraic point of view, and nor do those of any other rank: a parallel, but less intricate, development can be provided for the second-rank ones.},

	abstract = {The stability of a solid solution to all infinitesimal composition fluctuations is considered, taking surface tension and elastic energy into account. It is found that for infinite isotropic solids, free from imperfections the spinodal marks the limit of metastability to such fluctuations only if there is no change in molar volume with composition. Otherwise the elastic energy due to a fluctuation stabilizes the solution and alters the criterion for the limit of metastability. For an unstable solution the kinetics of decomposition are discussed and the expected mean particle size or wavelength of the most rapidly growing fluctuation is derived.

Zusammenfassung
Die Stabilit{\"a}t einer festen L{\"o}sung gegen{\"u}ber allen infinitesimalen Schwankungen der Zusammensetzung wird betrachtet, dabei werden Oberfl{\"a}chenspannung und elastische Energie mit ber{\"u}cksichtigt. Es wird gezeigt, daβ im unendlichen, isotropen und fehlerfreien Festk{\"o}rper die Spinodale nur dann die Grenze der Metastabilit{\"a}t bez{\"u}glich solchen Schwankungen darstellt, wenn sich das molare Volumen mit der Zusammensetzung nicht {\"a}ndert. Andernfalls stabilisiert die mit der Schwankung verkn{\"u}pfte elastische Energie die L{\"o}sung und ver{\"a}ndert die Bedingungen f{\"u}r die Grenze der Metastabilit{\"a}t. F{\"u}r eine instabile L{\"o}sung wird die Kinetik der Umsetzung diskutiert und die zu erwartende mittlere Teilchengr{\"o}βe oder die Wellenl{\"a}nge der am schnellsten wachsenden Schwankung abgeleitet.},

	abstract = {{A thermodynamic model for the quaternary white mica solid solution with end-members muscovite--Mg-celadonite--paragonite--Fe-celadonite (Ms--MgCel--Pg--FeCel) is presented. The interaction energies for the MgCel--Pg join, the FeCel--Pg join and the ternary interactions were obtained from natural coexisting phengite--paragonite pairs. Phengite--paragonite pairs were selected based on the criteria that their chemical compositions may be represented as a linear combination of the model end-member compositions and that the respective formation conditions (350--650$\,^{\circ}$C, 4--21 kbar) are accurately known. Previously published excess free energy expressions were used for the Ms--Pg, Ms--MgCel and Ms--FeCel binaries. The suggested mixing model was tested by calculating multicomponent equilibrium phase diagrams. This proved to be particularly well suited to reproduce compositional variations of white micas from amphibolite-facies metapelites.}},

	abstract = {Non-Fickian diffusion driven by gradients in chemical potential rather than concentration is important for nonideal mixtures. Conventional formulations of the chemical potential must be supplemented by a gradient term whenever phase separation is possible. Equilibrium composition profiles are predicted in both confined and large systems using the Landau--Ginzburg functional. Parameter estimates based on mean-field theories work well for polymers. The dynamics of phase change are described by the modified Cahn--Hilliard equation. Domain growth in quiescent systems occurs by Ostwald ripening and by hydrodynamics induced by concentration gradients. Simulations without adjustable constants are used to predict non-equilibrium morphologies in binary and ternary polymer. Experimentally confirmed morphologies include dual-continuous phases, dual-dispersed phases, core-shell particles and more complex structures. Most impurities are enriched at the phase boundaries.},

	abstract = {{Coexisting paragonite and phengite in an eclogite from the Franciscan Formation at Cazadero, California, were studied by transmission electron microscopy. The phengites are characterized by high Fe + Mg (0.48 per 2 octahedral cations) and Si (3.21 per 4 tetrahedral cations). The phengite has 15 mole\\% Na substituting for K, and the paragonite has 7 mole\\% K substituting for Na.Half-micron sized lamellae of phengite were observed intergrown in paragonite, but not vice versa. Phengite is predominantly a well-ordered 2M1 polytype almost free of stacking disorder, except for phengite lamellae intergrown within paragonite. However, paragonite is highly imperfect, with stacking disorder and a high density of edge dislocation-like features. Paragonite shows stacking disorder originating from random layer rotations of n(120$\,^{\circ}$) and also exhibits complex polytypism. Although most paragonite is a 2M1 polytype, there are locally random intercalations of a 3-layer polytype. In addition, the 2-layer and 3-layer polytypes are intercalated in an ordered fashion resulting in an 8-layer polytype composed of a 2-layer and two 3-layer subunits. Phengite is locally deformed below optical microscopic resolution and shows complex bending and kinking.}},

This expression is used to determine the properties of a flat interface between two coexisting phases. In particular, we find that the thickness of the interface increases with increasing temperature and becomes infinite at the critical temperature Tc, and that at a temperature T just below Tc the interfacial free energy σ is proportional to (Tc−T)32.The predicted interfacial free energy and its temperature dependence are found to be in agreement with existing experimental data. The possibility of using optical measurements of the interface thickness to provide an additional check of our treatment is briefly discussed.}},

@article{Cahn:1994aa,
	abstract = {We explore two phenomenological approaches leading to systems of coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Cahn-Allen equations for describing the dynamics of systems which can undergo first-order phase separation and order-disorder transitions simultaneously, starting from the same discrete lattice free energy function. In the first approach, a quasicontinuum limit is taken for this discrete energy and the evolution of the system is then assumed to be given by gradient flow. In the second approach, a discrete set of gradient flow evolution equations is derived for the lattice dynamics and a quasicontinuum limit is then taken. We demonstrate in the context of BCC Fe−Al binary alloys that it is important that variables be chosen that accommodate the variations in the average concentration as well as the underlying ordered structure of the possible coexistent phases. Only then will the two approaches lead to roughly the same continuum descriptions. We conjecture that in general the number of variables necessary to describe the dynamics of such systems is equal toN1+N2−1, whereN1 is given by the dimension of the span of the bases of the irreducible representations needed to describe the symmetry groups of the possible equilibrium phases andN2 is the number of chemical components.N1 of these variables are nonconserved, and the remaining are conserved and represent the average concentrations. For the Fe−Al alloys this implies a description of one conserved order parameter and one nonconserved order parameter. The resultant description is given by a Cahn-Hilliard equation coupled to a Cahn-Allen equation via the lower-order nonlinear terms. The rough equivalence of the two phenomenological methods adds credibility to the validity of the resulting evolution equations. A similar description should also be valid for alloy systems in which the structure of the competing phases is more complicated.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamic basis of several recent attempts to formulate a simple two-feldspar geothermometer is discussed, together with a review of earlier empirical geothermometers and ones based on experimental studies in the ternary feldspar system. It is shown that double-binary thermometers which involve the combination of regular solution mixing models for the binary alkali feldspar system with ideal mixing in plagioclases do not give a satisfactory representation of two-feldspar relations, especially for albite-rich compositions where a critical point exists. Thermometers based on mixing parameters for ordered alkali feldspar frameworks are even more unjustified both because low-plagioclases are certainly non-ideal, and because of uncertainty in knowing the degree of Al-Si order in the alkali feldspar when exchange equilibrium was achieved. A `thermodynamic'thermometer requires knowledge of ternary activities which are at present unknown.},

Only a few experiments have reported three-dimensional (3D) coarsening in binary semi-solid alloys, which differs from the LSW theory. We report here on in situ coarsening of Al--Ge32 (wt.), which is used as a model system for a large variety of technical alloys. Numerical analysis of 2D and 3D images of the microstructure measured by X-ray radiography and microtomography reveals the evolution of the solid particles during annealing. Ripening of a grain-refined particle network is found to be quite well described by LSW theory, although somewhat smaller exponents (t1/4--t1/5) are found. Changes in coarsening behavior are observed in samples which are thinner than 0.5mm, as well as in non-equiaxed alloy microstructures, characterized by anisotropic dendrites.},

@article{LIFSHITZ196135,
	abstract = {An analysis is made of the process whereby diffusion effects can cause the precipitation of grains of a second phase in a supersaturated solid solution. The kinetics of this type of grain growth are examined in detail. Some grains grow, only to be later dissolved; others increase in size and incorporate further grains that they encounter in so doing. This latter phenomenon of coalescence is discussed in a new ``kinetic'' approximation. Formulae are given for the asymptotic grain size distribution, for the number of grains per unit volume and for the supersaturation as a function of time. The effects of anisotropy, strain, crystalline order and the finite size of the specimen are allowed for. It is pointed out that for a material that can be said to be ``supersaturated with vacancies'', the discussion can be applied to the vacancies as solute ``atoms'' which cluster together to form internal cavities. The practical case of a real, finite crystal is here important, because the vacancies can in general also escape to the surface. A special analysis is made of this example, and the results are applied to the theory of sintering.},

@article{Williame:a28672,
	abstract = {On the basis of proposals by Cahn [{\it Acta Met.} (1962). {\bf 10}, 179-183] for cubic crystals, a coherent elastic model is developed which makes it possible for the orientations of exsolution boundaries formed either by spinodal decomposition or homogeneous nucleation to be predicted. The elastic energy for the coherent exsolution boundary is calculated for all orientations of the boundary, the minimum value for this energy corresponding to the predicted boundary. A program has been written which can be applied to all crystal systems; it uses as input the lattice parameters of crystals having the same compositions as the exsolution domains and their corresponding elastic stiffnesses. The approximations of the model are discussed, especially the neglect of relaxation of the coherence stresses away from the boundary, and the uncertainties in the calculated results due to errors in or lack of knowledge of the input data. The coherent elastic model has been used to determine the orientations of exsolution boundaries in the feldspars. The agreement between calculated and observed exsolution boundaries is remarkable, considering that room-temperature lattice parameters and elastic stiffnesses are used. The angular differences are less than 3{$^\circ$} in most cases. They may reach 20{$^\circ$} in the labradorites because the input data are not well known. All observed exsolution boundaries have been accounted for and some unknown ones calculated. The results of the calculations may be used to explain the cause of the exsolution orientations and to suggest areas requiring further research.},

	abstract = {{Mineral grains are not just chemical compounds; they possess microtexture. The properties of crystallographically near-perfect ``gem-quality'' alkali feldspar crystals are contrasted here with those of ordinary, ``garden-variety'' specimens, exemplified by perthitic phenocrysts from the granite at Shap, northern England. These are representative of common alkali feldspars in the crust. Two well-studied gem-quality materials (Madagascar orthoclase and Eifel sanidine) vary at the source in microtextural and other properties. Some crystals of Eifel sanidine exhibit much more rapid Si--Al ordering than ordinary feldspars, probably because of the presence of a hydrogen species. The complex microtextures of two feldspars from pegmatites that have been used in studies of dissolution rate, Perth perthite and Keystone microcline, are described and compared with textures in the Shap feldspars. Microtextures, in particular misfit dislocations on regular exsolution-lamellae of albite, are crucially important in chemical dissolution and mechanical degradation during natural weathering in acid peat soils at Shap. In contrast, during laboratory dissolution-rate experiments carried out far from equilibrium, natural defects are less important than edges and steps produced during the grinding of the samples. Diagenetic replacement-type reactions in an overlying conglomerate at Shap are also strongly sensitive to microtexture. In arkosic sandstones in the Jurassic Fulmar Formation of the central North Sea, the detrital alkali feldspar inventory has been subject to microtextural winnowing, with relatively defect-free varieties of alkali feldspar being relatively more abundant than would be expected from the distribution of rock types known in the North Sea catchment.Les grains de min{\'e}raux ne sont pas simplement des compos{\'e}s chimiques; ils poss{\`e}dent une microtexture. Les propri{\'e}t{\'e}s de cristaux gemmes de feldspath alcalin sont ici compar{\'e}es avec celles de cristaux perthitiques tout-{\`a}-fait ordinaires provenant du granite de Shap, au nord de l'Angleterre. Ces derniers seraient repr{\'e}sentatifs des feldspaths communs de la cro{\^u}te. Deux mat{\'e}riaux gemmes bien {\'e}tudi{\'e}s, l'orthose du Madagascar et la sanidine d'Eifel, sont pris de populations variables {\`a} la source dans leur microtexture et leurs propri{\'e}t{\'e}s. Certains cristaux provenant de l'Eifel font preuve d'une mise en ordre Si--Al beaucoup plus rapide que ces feldspaths ordinaires, probablement {\`a} cause d'une esp{\`e}ce hydrog{\'e}n{\'e}e. Les microtextures complexes de deux feldspaths provenant de pegmatites et utilis{\'e}s dans les {\'e}tudes du taux de dissolution, la perthite de Perth et le microcline de Keystone, sont d{\'e}crites et compar{\'e}es aux textures des feldspaths provenant de Shap. Ces microtextures, en particulier les dislocations dues au d{\'e}calage le long des lamelles d'exsolution d'albite, sont tr{\`e}s importantes dans la dissolution chimique et la d{\'e}gradation m{\'e}chanique au cours du lessivage naturel dans les sols acides des tourbi{\`e}res {\`a} Shap. En revanche, au cours des exp{\'e}riences de laboratoire visant {\`a} caract{\'e}riser la dissolution {\`a} des conditions loin de l'{\'e}quilibre, les d{\'e}fauts naturels semblent moins importants que le dommage cr{\'e}{\'e} lors de la pr{\'e}paration des {\'e}chantillons. Les r{\'e}actions diag{\'e}n{\'e}tiques de type remplacement dans un conglom{\'e}rat reposant sur le granite {\`a} Shap d{\'e}pendent aussi de la microtexture.

	abstract = {The temperature dependence of cell parameters for three disordered, synthetic alkali feldspars (Or19, Or38, and Or100) has been determined up to 1,000 $\,^{\circ}$C. The samples show no change in composition or degree of Si-Al disorder during the experiments. The triclinic-monoclinic inversion in the sample of composition Or19 occurs at 560 $\,^{\circ}$$\pm$10 $\,^{\circ}$C and is accompanied by changes in the rates of expansion of a, b and c; the rate for a increases and those for b and c decrease above the inversion. The b and c parameters in Or100 show small decreases with increasing temperature and this may be due to thermal motion effects causing a contraction of cell directions that are fully expanded at room temperature. Calculation of the thermal expansion ellipsoids for the monoclinic phases shows that the major expansion coefficients (α1) for all three samples are more than an order of magnitude greater than the intermediate (α2) and minor (α3) coefficients. Thus the thermal expansion of these phases is dominated by that of α1 which makes an angle of 22 $\pm$4 $\,^{\circ}$with+a; this orientation is parallel to that of the short M-OA2 bonds. The thermal expansion mechanism for monoclinic, disordered alkali feldspars may involve tilting within the framework releasing compression along this direction and allowing the M-OA2 bonds to show high expansion rates. The stretching of the crankshaft units, which are parallel to a, may only play a subordinate role in controlling the expansion of the feldspar framework.},

	abstract = {{X-ray powder diffraction data obtained on a heating stage determined the unit-cell parameters of low albite to 1127$\,^{\circ}$C and high albite to above 1000$\,^{\circ}$C. Low albite remained triclinic at all temperatures studied. Contamination of high albite by potassium from the heating stage seriously affected the results, and the only monoclinic phases observed at high temperatures proved to be potassium-bearing anorthoclases when studied at room temperature. After correction for compositional effects, the best estimate of the triclinic-monoclinic inversion in NaAlSi3O8 is 1100$\,^{\circ}$$\pm$50$\,^{\circ}$C. It is uncertain if monalbite occurs before melting takes place.Good agreement is shown with earlier data obtained by dilatometry by others on low albite, though the present results give axial and angular details previously unavailable, as well as new data for high albite. Various expressions of the volume thermal expansion of each polymorph are presented. The percent volume expansions of both polymorphs are almost identical, but the coefficients of thermal expansion are not. The effect of temperature on the cell angles of both polymorphs is the same as that caused by solid solution with potassium feldspar. The effects of temperature on the position of the rhombic section and on the obliquity are calculated.}},

	abstract = {A general mass conservation equation for either stable or radioactive chemical components in an open magmatic system is formulated. The equation is applied to trace elements by assuming melt-mineral equilibrium defined by a partition coefficient. A derived analytic expression has very wide applicability, and most of the mass conservation equations in the literature for stable trace elements are obtained by choosing appropriate values for the controlling model parameters, such as material influx or separation rate and melt fraction in the system. The general equation is also modified to facilitate an application to multistage problems. It is demonstrated that the general open system mass conservation equation for melting processes expressed without melt fraction is mathematically identical to that for one-dimensional steady state two-phase flow with sink and source terms. This one-dimensional steady state model is applied to depleted abyssal peridotites to constrain their melting processes in an ascending mantle beneath ridges. The rare earth element (REE) patterns of clinopyroxene are fitted by optimizing melting parameters, and the results indicate a continuous influx of light REE (LREE)-enriched melt up to 3--11\% in degree of melting, which amounts in total to less than 1\% of the initial peridotite mass. The open system melting equation for trace elements is also applied to peridotites from the Hayachine-Miyamori ophiolite, northeastern Japan. The REE contents in clinopyroxene and the modal abundances in four peridotite groups are fitted all together to estimate melting reaction stoichiometry and REE contents in the influxing material. The estimated REE pattern is characterized by a strong LREE enrichment, which is comparable to that of melt in equilibrium with hornblende in the most refractory harzburgite from the ophiolite.},

@article{am20124011,
	abstract = {{Following the ideas of Helen Megaw, we describe the changes in the conformation of the tetrahedral framework of feldspars in terms of just four distinct tilt systems of rigid tetrahedra. These systems are based on the four allowed tilts of a ring of four corner-linked tetrahedra with point symmetry 2. Of the four tilt systems, only two result in significant volume change of the unit cell. We show that all of the essential features of the structures, unit-cell parameters and volumes of the AlSi3 feldspars, and their expansion and compression induced by changes in pressure, temperature, and composition at crustal pressures, are generated by the simultaneous application of these two tilts to an un-tilted framework of regular tetrahedra. In combination these two tilts impose significant anisotropy upon the expansion of the unit cell of the feldspar with the majority of the expansion accommodated by the expansion of d(100). This demonstrates that the fundamental reason for the anisotropy of feldspars lies in the topology of the tetrahedral framework. A comparison of the actual tilts observed in alkali feldspars with the model shows that the tilts maximize the shortest O-O distances in the structure, and therefore O-O repulsions along with the volume requirement control the values of the tetrahedral tilts in alkali feldspars and thus the anisotropy of the structure. Therefore, the bonding requirements of the bridging O atoms and the directionality of the bonding to the extraframework cations only play a secondary role in modifying this basic pattern of anisotropy, which is intrinsic to the common topology of the framework of all feldspars.}},

Mole fraction Or (nor) is related to cell volume (V) by equations for the (AA)-(HS) series, nor=−535.186+2.37332V−3.52656⋅10−3V2+1.75614.10−6V3s.e.e.=0.003nor(s.e.e.=standard error of estimate), and the (LA)-(LM) series, nor=−1209.142+5.28104V−7.70522.10−3V2+3.75650.10−6V3s.e.e.=0.004nor. The influence of An-content on estimating nor can be accounted for from the volume data of the ternary series. The volume behavior of the alkali feldspars is characterized by Margules parameters Wv[cal/bar] that are similar for AA and HS: WV(AA)=0.083(7),WV(HS)=0.070(11), but are markedly dissimilar for LA and LM: WV(LA)=0.111(5),WV(LM)=0.015(12) That is, the excess volume is nearly symmetric in the disordered series, but it is definitely asymmetric in the ordered series and thus depends on the degree of Al,Si order. Its behavior is discussed in terms of two factors: geometrical dilatation and chemical contraction.}},

	abstract = {{Eleven compositions in the microcline-low albite solid solution were produced by dry homogenization at 900$\,^{\circ}$C of mixtures of Ab-rich and Or-rich end members produced from a natural ``maximum microcline'' by cation exchange with molten alkali chlorides at 900$\,^{\circ}$C. Twenty compositions in the sanidine-high albite solid solution were crystallized from glasses under hydrothermal conditions.Unit-cell parameters were determined from X-ray powder data for both the microcline-low albite and the sanidine-high albite solid solutions by means of a least-squares refinement computer program.The volume curves for both feldspar series show positive volumes of mixing. The maximum volume of mixing for the microcline-low albite series is 1.3 percent at Or50.6 mole percent and for the sanidine-high albite series, 0.9 percent at Or55.1 mole percent. Volume curves for the two series nearly coincide between Or100 and Or20Ab80 but more Ab-rich compositions show significantly lower volumes in the microcline-low albite solid solution.The triclinic to monoclinic symmetry transformation in the sanidine-high albite solid solution occurs at 43.5 $\pm$ 2.0 mole percent Or at room temperature.Because unit-cell dimension a is nearly independent of structural state and strongly dependent on composition, it provides a useful measure of composition for alkali feldspars. For a given structural state, variation in a of about 0.004 {\AA} corresponds to a composition variation of 1.0 percent Or. The maximum effect of A1: Si order on a is equivalent to the effect of 4 percent Or.X-ray determinative curves for the microcline-low albite and the sanidine-high albite series are given in terms of spacings for the reflections (201) and (400), and Δ2θ for the reflection (201) using KBrO3 as an internal standard.The trend of compositions as plotted on an α-γ diagram suggests that the microcline-low albite series prepared in this study is slightly less ordered than true ``maximum'' microcline but more ordered than most natural microcline specimens.}},

@article{JUN20101678,
	abstract = {The study of residual stress has long been an important research field in science and engineering, due to the fact that uncontrolled residual stresses are detrimental to the performance of products. Numerous research contributions have been devoted to the quantification of residual stress states for the purpose of designing engineering components and predicting their lifetime and failure in service. For the purposes of the present study these can be broadly classified into two main approaches, namely, the interpretation of experimental measurements and process modelling. In this paper, a novel approach to residual stress analysis is developed, called here the Eigenstrain Reconstruction Method (ERM). This is a semi-empirical approach that combines experimental characterisation, specifically, residual elastic strain measurement by diffraction, with subsequent analysis and interpretation based on the eigenstrain theory. Three essential components of the ERM, i.e. the residual strain measurement, the solution of the inverse problem of eigenstrain theory, and the Simple Triangle (SIMTRI) method, are described. The ERM allows an approximate reconstruction of the complete residual strain and stress state in the entire engineering component. This is a significant improvement compared to the experimentally obtained limited knowledge of stress components at a selected number of measurement points, or to the simple interpolation between these points.},

The excess energy associated with compositional gradients at the lamellar interfaces was quantified from the initial wavelength of the lamellar microstructure and the lamellar compositions as obtained from atom probe tomography using the Cahn--Hilliard theory. The capability of atom probe tomography to deliver quantitative chemical compositions at nm resolution opens new perspectives for studying the early stages of exsolution. In particular, it helps to shed light on the phase relations in nm scaled coherent intergrowth.},

	abstract = {Phase separation in a three-component system that results from the uphill diffusion of chemical components is considered. The binary decomposition model of Cahn and Hilliard is generalized to account for the interdiffusion of several chemical components with considerably different diffusion constants. Thereafter the decomposition dynamics and the phase relations of the final system state are investigated by means of finite-element modeling. Examples from a hypothetical regular solution and from ternary feldspar are addressed. Special attention is given to situations in which different diffusivities affect decomposition dynamics and the final system states. Good qualitative agreement between our modeling and petrographic observations on exsolved feldspar is achieved. Our model explains systematic deviations from equilibrium element partitioning between the two phases exsolving from an initially homogeneous ternary feldspar during slow cooling.},

	abstract = {We investigated the external morphologies and internal compositional zoning patterns of clinopyroxene phenocrysts in an ankaramite of Haleakala volcano (Hawaii) to constrain magma crystallization conditions in the volcano's postshield stage. The phenocrysts are characterized by euhedral faceted morphologies and crystallographically coherent subcrystals. Quantitative EPMA and X-ray element mapping reveal two domains within the crystals: porous, Si--Mg--Ca--Cr-rich zones associated with the forms {\{}100{\}}, {\{}010{\}} and {\{}110{\}}, and nonporous, Al--Ti--Na-rich zones associated with the forms {\{}−111{\}}. The chemical variations, internal porosity and parallel subcrystals are consistent with nonconcentric crystal growth at varying degrees of supersaturation. We infer that initial growth occurred in a diffusion-limited regime to produce dendritic crystals; subsequent growth was markedly slower, with lesser supersaturation allowing dendrites to infill and produce polyhedral external morphologies. This sequence promoted the evolution of crystals from an hourglass shape with dominant {\{}−111{\}} forms, to sector-zoned euhedral crystals in which elements were partitioned according to: (Al + Ti + Na){\{}−111{\}} = (Si + Mg + Cr + Ca){\{}110{\}},{\{}100{\}},{\{}010{\}}. Infilling of dendritic crystals occurred to a greater extent on faster-growing sectors and was interrupted by the eruption, resulting in porosity of the slower-growing {\{}hk0{\}} sectors. Outermost Na-poor rims formed on all sectors due to slower growth rate under interface-limited conditions. Paradoxically, high levels of supersaturation producing large crystals of clinopyroxene (and olivine) are indicated in the volcano's deep-seated reservoir and lower degrees of supersaturation characterize syn-eruptive crystal growth. The presence of vapor bubbles within the melt-filled crystal embayments and inclusions suggests rapid clinopyroxene growth caused volatile saturation and reservoir pressurization, leading to eruption of the ankaramite.},

	abstract = {A thermodynamic analysis of coherent lamellar intergrowth resulting from the exsolution of initially homogeneous alkali feldspar is presented. In contrast to earlier treatments, where the simplifying assumption of zero strain in the lamellar interfaces was used, our treatment is more general. The elastic stresses and strains associated with coherent lamellar intergrowth of Na-rich and K-rich alkali feldspar are calculated by minimising the overall elastic energy of the lamellar microstructure. At given pressure and temperature, the elastic energy depends on the volume proportions of the two lamellar types, and thus on the composition of the homogeneous precursor feldspar. As a consequence, there is no single coherent solvus for alkali feldspar, but coherent solvi are different for different compositions of the homogeneous precursor phase. Experimentally observed lamellar orientations agree with those predicted by minimising the strain energy on a set of all possible lamellar orientations.},

	abstract = {{Alkali feldspars usually exhibit optical or sub-optical intergrowths of albite and K-feldspar (known generically as perthite) which have morphologies and crystallographic characteristics that are distinctive of the igneous or metamorphic environment in which they grew and cooled to surface temperatures. We review the current terminology and understanding of how the microtextures form and discuss their role in feldspar dissolution during weathering, transport, and diagenesis. We show how microtextures can be used as provenance indicators in arkosic siliciclastic rocks, using examples from the Fulmar Formation, a reservoir rock in the Upper Jurassic Humber group in the Central North Sea, in which feldspar dissolution is a major source of secondary porosity. We describe the most effective techniques for routine characterization, of which the most practical is back-scattered electron imaging in a scanning electron microscope, often coupled with cathodoluminescence. We provide an atlas of the main types of perthitic intergrowth likely to be encountered in igneous and metamorphic rocks worldwide, and show how many of the microtextures can be matched in clastic grains in the Fulmar Formation. Grains which are preferentially preserved have microtextures that make them relatively unreactive in aqueous fluids at low temperatures, and we conclude that provenance has a major impact on reservoir quality. Detrital grains in the Fulmar exhibit authigenic albitization, K-feldspar overgrowths, and replacement, and we discuss how diagenetic features can be distinguished from replacive features developed in the protolith.}},

@article{Parsons:2010aa,
	abstract = {Microtextural changes brought about by heating alkali feldspar crystals from the Shap granite, northern England, at atmospheric pressure, have been studied using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. A typical unheated phenocryst from Shap is composed of about 70 vol{\%} of tweed orthoclase with strain-controlled coherent or semicoherent micro- and crypto-perthitic albite lamellae, with maximum lamellar thicknesses <1 μm. Semicoherent lamellae are encircled by nanotunnel loops in two orientations and cut by pull-apart cracks. The average bulk composition of this microtexture is Ab27.6Or71.8An0.6. The remaining 30 vol{\%} is deuterically coarsened, microporous patch and vein perthite composed of incoherent subgrains of oligoclase, albite and irregular microcline. The largest subgrains are \~{}3 μm in diameter. Heating times in the laboratory were 12 to 6,792 h and T from 300$\,^{\circ}$C into the melting interval at 1,100$\,^{\circ}$C. Most samples were annealed at constant T but two were heated to simulate an 40Ar/39Ar step-heating schedule. Homogenisation of strain-controlled lamellae by Na↔K inter-diffusion was rapid, so that in all run products at >700$\,^{\circ}$C, and after >48 h at 700$\,^{\circ}$C, all such regions were essentially compositionally homogeneous, as indicated by X-ray analyses at fine scale in the transmission electron microscope. Changes in lamellar thickness with time at different T point to an activation energy of \~{}350 kJmol−1. A lamella which homogenised after 6,800 h at 600$\,^{\circ}$C, therefore, would have required only 0.6 s to do so in the melting interval at 1,100$\,^{\circ}$C. Subgrains in patch perthite homogenised more slowly than coherent lamellae and chemical gradients in patches persisted for >5,000 h at 700$\,^{\circ}$C. Homogenisation T is in agreement with experimentally determined solvi for coherent ordered intergrowths, when a 50--100$\,^{\circ}$C increase in T for An1 is applied. Homogenisation of lamellae appears to proceed in an unexpected manner: two smooth interfaces, microstructurally sharp, advance from the original interfaces toward the mid-line of each twinned, semicoherent lamella. In places, the homogenisation interfaces have shapes reflecting the local arrangements of nanotunnels or pull-aparts. Analyses confirm that the change in alkali composition is also relatively sharp at these interfaces. Si--Al disordering is far slower than alkali homogenisation so that tweed texture in orthoclase, tartan twinning in irregular microcline, and Albite twins in albite lamellae and patches persisted in all our experiments, including 5,478 h at 700$\,^{\circ}$C, 148 h at 1,000$\,^{\circ}$C and 5 h at 1,100$\,^{\circ}$C, even though the ensemble in each case was chemically homogeneous. Nanotunnels and pull-aparts were modified after only 50 min at 500$\,^{\circ}$C following the simulated 40Ar/39Ar step-heating schedule. New features called `slots'developed away from albite lamellae, often with planar traces linking slots to the closest lamella. Slot arrays were often aligned along ghost-like regions of diffraction contrast which may mark the original edges of lamellae. We suggest that the slot arrays result from healing of pull-aparts containing fluid. At 700$\,^{\circ}$C and above, the dominant defects were subspherical `bubbles', which evolved from slots or from regions of deuteric coarsening. The small degree of partial melting observed after 5 h at 1,100$\,^{\circ}$C was often in the vicinity of bubbles. Larger micropores, which formed at subgrain boundaries in patch perthite during deuteric coarsening, retain their shape up to the melting point, as do the subgrain boundaries themselves. It is clear that modification of defects providing potential fast pathways for diffusion in granitic alkali feldspars begins below 500$\,^{\circ}$C and that defect character progressively changes up to, and beyond, the onset of melting.},

	abstract = {Microperthitic feldspar crystals containing low microcline in a braid intergrowth often have distinctive microtextures including coarse semi- to in-coherent grain-boundary pleated rims and fine coherent intracrystalline Ab- and Or-rich pleats (Lee et al. 1997). The coarser pleated rims are generally separated from the braid microtexture in the crystal interior by a coherent to semi-coherent transitional zone. Partial phase separation has occurred in the transitional zone in step with that in the Ab- and Or-rich pleats at the grain boundaries, such that Ab-rich lamellar film micro-antiperthite alternates along (010) with more Or-rich lamellar film microperthite; the microtextures and phases are those expected for the respective local bulk compositions. Lamellar microtextures contain tweed orthoclase, whereas low microcline is the only K-feldspar in the fine coherent pleats and braid microperthite. We propose that the small coherent pleats developed from the braid microtexture by interaction of the spontaneous coherency strains with discontinuities within or at the surface of the crystal, and that their initial spacing is guided by that of the braid microperthite. We infer that the transitional zone formed by straightening of the zig-zag braid microtexture above the pleat heads during coarsening and partial phase separation. We further infer that the resulting coherency shear strains induced a reversal of the K-feldspar phase transformation, involving Si, Al disordering of low microcline into low sanidine, now tweed orthoclase, although the crystal was at a T within the hydrostatic T-stability of microcline.},

The latter comprise pyroxenes (diopside), amphiboles (tremolite), olivines (forsterite) in places replaced by serpentine, quartz, feldspars (potassium feldspars and plagioclases), epidote, zoisite, vesuvianite, scapolite, muscovite, biotite partly replaced by chlorite, phlogopite, rare grains of titanite, rutile, zircone, apatite, and small grains of ferric oxides and sulfides. Calcite exhibits intensive deformational e-twinning whereas dolomite is undeformed and untwined. All four known types of mechanical twins in calcite were recognized: thin Type I twins, straight thick Type II twins, curved, lensoid and tapered thick Type III twins, and thick patchy Type IV twins. Type III twins are the dominant mechanical twins in the Pohorje marbles indicating the temperature of deformation somewhat above 200 $\,^{\circ}$C. Since they lack signs of grain boundary recrystallization, we assume that the twinning was followed by a decrease temperature during exhumation. With increasing temperature the process of recrystallization along calcite grain becomes pronounced. Small individual untwined calcite crystals are progressively replacing bigger calcite grains. In few examples second generation of Type I deformational twins develop in recrystallized calcite grains, which also implies lowering of temperature due to exhumation.},

@article{monalbite1980,
	abstract = {{The temperatures Tdiff and Tdispl of the diffusive transformation high albite--monalbite and the displacive transformation analbite--monalbite were investigated by X-ray powder methods. Alkali feldspars of composition Or0,5,10,20,30 were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis at temperatures Tequil between 1060 and 700$\,^{\circ}$C. Run durations were sufficiently long (3--72 days) to allow the samples to reach Al, Si equilibrium distributions. Tdiff can be represented by the equation Tdispl[oC] = 978 --- 19.2 · Or, whereas Tdispi also depends on Tequili.e. the degree of Al,Si order, according to Tdispl[$\,^{\circ}$C] = 715 -- 18.9 · Or -- 0.221 · Or2 + 0.269 · Tequil. As a consequence Ordispl, the composition of the triclinic/monoclinic inversion at room temperature, also changes with Tequil : Ordispl[mol\\%] = 27.5 + 0.00842 ·TequilDistinction between topochemically triclinic and monoclinic symmetry is possible on the basis of the temperature variation of lattice angles α, γ and simple line separations; e.g. cos2α of high albite smoothly approaches but never reaches zero with increasing temperature, whereas cos2α of analbite is consistent with a straight-line extrapolation to zero. At room temperature an interval of uncertain distinction extends from γ = 90.18 to 90.25$\,^{\circ}$ and from Δ131 = 1.95 to 2.00 [$\pm$2θ] in high albite and analbite.Structural explanations are given (1) for the variations of α and γ with Al,Si order in equilibrated albites, (2) for the variations of α and γ due to short-term heating of albite and analbite, (3) for the dependence of Tdispl and Ordispl on Tequil, (4) for the result Tdispl ≥ Tdiffin Na-feldspar. Tdispl is thought to react sensitively on structural disturbances which may be caused by thermal and mechanical history, chemical impurities, and other factors. If Tdispl is found to be lower than Tdiff, this is ascribed to such defects.}},

It is found how the time-dependent period of this structure evolves in time.

@article{1059,
	abstract = {{Mineral grains are not just chemical compounds; they possess microtexture. The properties of crystallographically near-perfect ``gem-quality'' alkali feldspar crystals are contrasted here with those of ordinary, ``garden-variety'' specimens, exemplified by perthitic phenocrysts from the granite at Shap, northern England. These are representative of common alkali feldspars in the crust. Two well-studied gem-quality materials (Madagascar orthoclase and Eifel sanidine) vary at the source in microtextural and other properties. Some crystals of Eifel sanidine exhibit much more rapid Si--Al ordering than ordinary feldspars, probably because of the presence of a hydrogen species. The complex microtextures of two feldspars from pegmatites that have been used in studies of dissolution rate, Perth perthite and Keystone microcline, are described and compared with textures in the Shap feldspars. Microtextures, in particular misfit dislocations on regular exsolution-lamellae of albite, are crucially important in chemical dissolution and mechanical degradation during natural weathering in acid peat soils at Shap. In contrast, during laboratory dissolution-rate experiments carried out far from equilibrium, natural defects are less important than edges and steps produced during the grinding of the samples. Diagenetic replacement-type reactions in an overlying conglomerate at Shap are also strongly sensitive to microtexture. In arkosic sandstones in the Jurassic Fulmar Formation of the central North Sea, the detrital alkali feldspar inventory has been subject to microtextural winnowing, with relatively defect-free varieties of alkali feldspar being relatively more abundant than would be expected from the distribution of rock types known in the North Sea catchment.Les grains de min{\'e}raux ne sont pas simplement des compos{\'e}s chimiques; ils poss{\`e}dent une microtexture. Les propri{\'e}t{\'e}s de cristaux gemmes de feldspath alcalin sont ici compar{\'e}es avec celles de cristaux perthitiques tout-{\`a}-fait ordinaires provenant du granite de Shap, au nord de l'Angleterre. Ces derniers seraient repr{\'e}sentatifs des feldspaths communs de la cro{\^u}te. Deux mat{\'e}riaux gemmes bien {\'e}tudi{\'e}s, l'orthose du Madagascar et la sanidine d'Eifel, sont pris de populations variables {\`a} la source dans leur microtexture et leurs propri{\'e}t{\'e}s. Certains cristaux provenant de l'Eifel font preuve d'une mise en ordre Si--Al beaucoup plus rapide que ces feldspaths ordinaires, probablement {\`a} cause d'une esp{\`e}ce hydrog{\'e}n{\'e}e. Les microtextures complexes de deux feldspaths provenant de pegmatites et utilis{\'e}s dans les {\'e}tudes du taux de dissolution, la perthite de Perth et le microcline de Keystone, sont d{\'e}crites et compar{\'e}es aux textures des feldspaths provenant de Shap. Ces microtextures, en particulier les dislocations dues au d{\'e}calage le long des lamelles d'exsolution d'albite, sont tr{\`e}s importantes dans la dissolution chimique et la d{\'e}gradation m{\'e}chanique au cours du lessivage naturel dans les sols acides des tourbi{\`e}res {\`a} Shap. En revanche, au cours des exp{\'e}riences de laboratoire visant {\`a} caract{\'e}riser la dissolution {\`a} des conditions loin de l'{\'e}quilibre, les d{\'e}fauts naturels semblent moins importants que le dommage cr{\'e}{\'e} lors de la pr{\'e}paration des {\'e}chantillons.

The ordering is caused by the energy of Al, Si interchange between sites of different crystal-chemical types and the energy of nearest neighbour interaction. By taking into account the decrease in the energy of interchange between sites with increasing disordering and with increasing temperature, and by examining different relationships for site-to-site interchange energy and the nearest neighbour interaction, it is possible to understand the basic characteristics of the transformation from low (essentially ordered) to high (essentially disordered) albite as revealed by experiment.},

	abstract = {The central control of mineral weathering rates on biogeochemical systems has motivated studies of dissolution for more than 50 years. A complete physical picture that explains widely observed variations in dissolution behavior is lacking, and some data show apparent serious inconsistencies that cannot be explained by the largely empirical kinetic ``laws.'' Here, we show that mineral dissolution can, in fact, be understood through the same mechanistic theory of nucleation developed for mineral growth. In principle, this theory should describe dissolution but has never been tested. By generalizing nucleation rate equations to include dissolution, we arrive at a model that predicts how quartz dissolution processes change with undersaturation from step retreat, to defect-driven and homogeneous etch pit formation. This finding reveals that the ``salt effect,'' recognized almost 100 years ago, arises from a crossover in dominant nucleation mechanism to greatly increase step density. The theory also explains the dissolution kinetics of major weathering aluminosilicates, kaolinite and K-feldspar. In doing so, it provides a sensible origin of discrepancies reported for the dependence of kaolinite dissolution and growth rates on saturation state by invoking a temperature-activated transition in the nucleation process. Although dissolution by nucleation processes was previously unknown for oxides or silicates, our mechanism-based findings are consistent with recent observations of dissolution (i.e., demineralization) in biological minerals. Nucleation theory may be the missing link to unifying mineral growth and dissolution into a mechanistic and quantitative framework across the continuum of driving force.},

@article{pnas.2112679119,
	abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of particle-based crystallization is a formidable problem due to the complexity of macroscopic and interfacial forces driving particle dynamics. The oriented attachment (OA) pathway presents a particularly challenging phenomenon because it occurs only under select conditions and involves a precise crystallographic alignment of particle faces often from distances of several nanometers. Despite the progress made in recent years in understanding the driving forces for particle face selectivity and alignment, questions about the competition between ion-by-ion crystallization, near-surface nucleation, and OA remain. This study examines hydrothermal conditions leading to apparent OA for hematite using three initial particle morphologies with various exposed faces. All three particle types formed single-crystal or twinned one-dimensional (1D) chain-like structures along the [001] direction driven by the attractive interactions between (001) faces and repulsive interactions between other pairs of hematite faces. Moreover, simulations of the potential of mean force for iron species and scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) imaging confirm that the formation of 1D chains is a result of the attachment of independently nucleated particles and does not follow the near-surface nucleation or ion-by-ion crystallization pathways. These results highlight that strong face specificity along one crystallographic direction can render OA to be independent of initial particle morphology.},

@article{GROVE19842113,
	abstract = {The rate of CaAl-NaSi interdiffusion in plagioclase feldspar was determined under 1 atm anhydrous conditions over the temperature range 1400$\,^{\circ}$ to 1000$\,^{\circ}$C in calcic plagioclase (An80−81) by homogenizing coherent exsolution lamellae. The dependence of the average interdiffusion coefficient on temperature is given by the expression: D̃ = 10.99 (cm2/sec) exp(−123.4(kcal/mol)/RT), (T in $\,^{\circ}$K). This value is for diffusion perpendicular to the (03 1̄) interface of the lamellae. CaAl-NaSi interdiffusion is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude slower than oxygen diffusion in the temperature range 1400$\,^{\circ}$ to 1200$\,^{\circ}$C and possibly 10 orders of magnitude slower at subsolidus temperatures. The large differences in diffusion rates explain the apparent contradiction posed by the plagioclases of large layered intrusions (e.g., the Skaergaard), which retain delicate Ca, Na compositional zoning profiles on the micron scale, but have undergone complete oxygen isotopic exchange with heated meteoric groundwater from the surrounding wall rocks. CaAl-NaSi diffusion is slow, the closure temperature is high (within the solidus-liquidus interval), and Ca-Na zoning is preserved. Oxygen diffusion is faster, the closure temperature is lower (350$\,^{\circ}$-400$\,^{\circ}$C) and the feldspars exchange oxygen with the low-temperature hydrothermal fluids. The complex micron-scale oscillatory zones in plagioclase can also be used as cooling rate speedometers for volcanic and plutonic plagioclase. Cooling histories typical of large mafic intrusions (e.g. the Stillwater) are slow, begin at high initial temperatures (1200$\,^{\circ}$C) and result in homogenization of oscillatory zones on the scale of 10 microns. The oscillatory zones found in the plagioclase of granodioritic plutons are preserved because cooling is initiated at a lower temperature (1000$\,^{\circ}$C) limiting diffusion to submicron length scales despite the slow cooling rate of the intrusion.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new expression of the periodized discrete Green operator using the Discrete Fourier Transform method and consistent with the Fourier grid is derived from the classic ``Continuous Green Operator'' (CGO) in order to take explicitly into account the discreteness of the Discrete Fourier Transform methods. It is shown that the easy use of the conventional continuous Fourier transform of the modified Green operator (CGO approximation) for heterogeneous materials with eigenstrains leads to spurious oscillations when computing the local responses of composite materials close to materials discontinuities like interfaces, dislocations. In this paper, we also focus on the calculation of the displacement field and its associated discrete Green operator which may be useful for materials characterization methods like diffraction techniques. We show that the development of these new consistent discrete Green operators in the Fourier space named ``Discrete Green Operators'' (DGO) allows to eliminate oscillations while retaining similar convergence capability. For illustration, a DGO for strain-based modified Green tensor is implemented in an iterative algorithm for heterogeneous periodic composites with eigenstrain fields. Numerical examples are reported, such as the computation of the local stresses and displacements of composite materials with homogeneous or heterogeneous elasticity combined with dilatational eigenstrain or eigenstrain representing prismatic dislocation loops. The numerical stress and displacement solutions obtained with the DGO are calculated for cubic-shaped inclusions, spherical Eshelby and inhomogeneity problems. The results are discussed and compared with analytical solutions and the classic discretization method using the CGO.},

We propose an alternate method based on Fourier series which avoids meshing and which makes direct use of microstructure images. It is based on the exact expression of the Green function of a linear elastic and homogeneous comparison material. First, the case of elastic nonhomogeneous constituents is considered and an iterative procedure is proposed to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation which naturally arises in the problem. Then, the method is extended to non-linear constituents by a step-by-step integration in time. The accuracy of the method is assessed by varying the spatial resolution of the microstructures. The flexibility of the method allows it to serve for a large variety of microstructures.},

	abstract = {Abstract A numerical method making use of fast Fourier transforms has been proposed in Moulinec and Suquet (1994, 1998) to investigate the effective properties of linear and non-linear composites. This method is based on an iterative scheme the rate of convergence of which is proportional to the contrast between the phases. Composites with high contrast (typically above 104) or infinite contrast (those containing voids or rigid inclusions or highly non-linear materials) cannot be handled by the method. This paper presents two modified schemes. The first one is an accelerated scheme for composites with high contrast which extends to elasticity a scheme initially proposed in Eyre and Milton (1999). Its rate of convergence varies as the square root of the contrast. The second scheme, adequate for composites with infinite contrast, is based on an augmented Lagrangian method. The resulting saddle-point problem involves three steps. The first step consists of solving a linear elastic problem, using the fast Fourier transform method. In the second step, a non-linear problem is solved at each individual point in the volume element. The third step consists of updating the Lagrange multiplier. Applications of this scheme to rigidly reinforced and to voided composites are shown. Copyright {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Intracrystalline diffusion is an invaluable tool for estimating timescales of geological events. Diffusion is typically modeled using gradients in chemical potential caused by variations in composition. However, chemical potential is derived for uniform pressure and temperature conditions and therefore cannot be used to model diffusion when there are gradients in stress. Internal stress variations in minerals will create gradients in strain energy which, in addition to gradients in composition, will drive diffusion. Consequently, it is necessary to have a method that incorporates stress variations into diffusion models. To address this issue, we have derived a flux expression that allows diffusion to be modeled in ionic, crystalline solids under arbitrary stress states. Our approach is consistent with standard petrological methods but instead utilizes gradients in a thermodynamic potential called ``relative chemical potential.'' Relative chemical potential accounts for the lattice constraint in crystalline solids by quantifying changes in free energy due to the exchanges of constituents on lattice sites under arbitrary stress conditions. Consequently, gradients in relative chemical potential can be used to model diffusion when pressure is not uniform (i.e., under conditions of non-hydrostatic stress). We apply our derivation to the common quaternary garnet solid solution almandine--pyrope--grossular--spessartine. The rates and directions of divalent cation diffusion in response to stress are determined by endmember molar volumes or lattice parameters, elastic moduli, and non-ideal activity interaction parameters. Our results predict that internal stress variations of one hundred MPa or more are required to shift garnet compositions by at least a few hundredths of a mole fraction. Mineral inclusions in garnet present a potential environment to test and apply our stress-driven diffusion approach, as stress variations ranging from hundreds of MPa to GPa-level are observed or predicted around such inclusions. The ability to model stress-induced diffusion may provide new information about the magnitudes of both intracrystalline stresses and the timescales during which they occurred, imparting a better understanding of large-scale tectono-metamorphic processes.},

These include magma generation and related arc volcanism, shallow and deep seismicity, and metamorphic reactions that can release fluids. Computational models can predict the thermal structure to great numerical precision when models are fully described but this does not guarantee accuracy or applicability. In a trio of companion papers, the construction of thermal subduction zone models, their use in subduction zone studies, and their link to geophysical and geochemical observations are explored. In part I, the motivation to understand the thermal structure is presented based on experimental and observational studies. This is followed by a description of a selection of thermal models for the Japanese subduction zones.},

	abstract = {Abstract Gradients in chemical potential are the driving force for chemical diffusion and their spatial distribution is thus essential to investigate equilibrium in metamorphic rocks. At high temperatures (>650 $\,^{\circ}$C), where chemical diffusion is relatively fast, the development and preservation of compositional zoning in minerals can be controlled by mechanically maintained pressure variations. Therefore, the dependence of chemical potentials on pressure plays an important role in correct interpretations of rock microstructures. Distinguishing between pressure-controlled chemical zoning and zoning reflecting chemical diffusion is a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we investigate a symplectitic microstructure around kyanite in an amphibolitized eclogite from the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex (Greece). The sample recrystallized at high temperatures (~720 $\,^{\circ}$C) and low pressures (<1 GPa) during which kyanite was replaced by fine-grained symplectites of sapphirine, spinel, plagioclase and corundum. The plagioclase rim around kyanite shows a cusp-shaped chemical zoning of calcium along the grain boundaries. The results from combined phase equilibria and diffusion modelling show that the cusp-like shapes were developed by fast grain boundary diffusion at constant pressure after the relaxation of grain-scale pressure variations across the plagioclase rim. The results illustrate an example where petrographic observations help to distinguish between mechanically- and diffusion-controlled chemical zoning.},

	abstract = {Abstract Grain-scale pressure variations have recently been investigated due to its significant effect on the observed microstructures and chemical redistribution in metamorphic rocks. In this study, the impact of grain-scale pressure variation on a growing garnet grain is investigated. We model prograde garnet growth at fluid-saturated conditions and sufficiently low temperature (<650 $\,^{\circ}$C) to avoid modification of the inner part of the grain by diffusion. The method uses the Perple\_X computer program package combined with Matlab{\textregistered} scripts allowing for a heterogeneous fluid pressure distribution around the growing grain. It is shown that the pressure variation around the grain may result in an asymmetric chemical zonation. Motivated by the result, we apply the model to selected published prograde paths to evaluate the magnitude of the pressure variation that is necessary for the development of the asymmetric zoning preserved in the samples. The magnitude of such a pressure gradient in the selected samples may correspond up to 1 kbar. Finally, it is demonstrated that the modelling of asymmetric chemical zoning in garnet under a pressure gradient may improve the precision of thermobarometric constraints. The numerical model evaluates the effect of the pressure gradient on a growing grain and thus can serve as a benchmark tool in future development of fully coupled models involving rock deformation and mineral reactions.},

	abstract = {Sheltered inside crystals, mineral inclusions preserve crucial information on the geological history of our planet. These inclusions allow estimation of the pressure and temperature trajectories of metamorphic rocks, but also can tell about rock mineralogy, provenance, and geodynamic and petrogenetic processes. This information is recovered under the axiom that mineral inclusions have remained immutable objects that do not change shape after their entrapment. Conversely, we show that post-entrapment shape modifications do occur in high-T rocks from granulite-facies conditions. Here we analyze the shape and orientation of quartz inclusions within garnet, a common metamorphic mineral. Our data reveal a progressive change in shape from irregularly-shaped forms in rocks formed at T<550$\,^{\circ}$C, to combined dodecahedron and icositetrahedron geometries imposed by the host garnet in granulites equilibrated at T>750$\,^{\circ}$C. Lack of fluid at the quartz-garnet phase boundary indicates that inclusion shape change occurs by thermally-induced grain boundary diffusion, driven by the minimization of the surface energy of the host-inclusion system. Since inclusions acquire a negative crystal shape after entrapment, our discovery redefines the conceptual framework for the application of elastic thermobarometry, and motivates a reevaluation of the criteria for mineral inclusion syngenesis in metamorphic rocks.},

Interfacial energies in binary metallic systems were estimated from a few bulk thermodynamic properties, i.e., melting temperature, entropy of fusion, and the critical temperature of the liquid phase. In eutectic systems, interfacial energy gradually increases with decreasing concentration of the solid species in the liquid. In monotectic systems, interfacial thickening occurs and interfacial energy is reduced around the liquid immiscibility gap. The results of calculation explain the experimental data of dihedral angles fairly well.},

	abstract = {The main driving force behind Al/Si ordering in tetrahedral framework aluminosilicates is nearest-neighbour Al/Al avoidance. Computer simulation is used to explore the direct consequences of such Al/Al avoidance. The main result is that the order-disorder transition temperature Tcfalls dramatically as the concentration x of Al in the structure is reduced, and if the only interactions are those associated with nearest-neighbour Al/Al avoidance, Tcbecomes zero for x less than some critical value xc, where xc=0.31 for the feldspar framework and xc=0.34 for cordierite. Also a large degree of short range order is found above Tc. Both results differ radically from the standard Bragg-Williams model. Plots of entropy and enthalpy of ordering are given as functions of x and T, which may be used to interpret experimental data or for extrapolation into ranges of x and T inaccessible to experiment.},

@article{Dohmen1319,
	abstract = {One-atmosphere experiments in the system diopside-albite-anorthite (Di-Ab-An) have been used to explore the controls on plagioclase-melt partitioning of trace elements (Li, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Zn, Sr, Ba, La, Sm, Y). By performing experiments along isotherms it was possible to isolate compositional controls from those of temperature. The lattice strain model accounts for variations in partition coefficients (Kp(i)) for isovalent series of cations (in+) and the experimental data are used to optimize the lattice strain parameters so that partition coefficients for n = 1 to 3 can be derived from Kp(Na), Kp(Ca), and Kp(La), respectively, at the conditions of interest. The optimized lattice strain parameters have magnitudes and compositional and thermal dependences that are consistent with elastic data for plagioclases. Kp(La) is parameterized via an exchange reaction involving CaAl2Si2O8 and the La-feldspar component La0.5Na0.5Al2Si2O8. The free energy change of this reaction is small, but well constrained by the data, such that for a given P-T-X Kp(La) can be derived from a combination of Kp(Na) and Kp(Ca). In the case where Kp(Na) and Kp(Ca) are independently constrained, the models reproduce the experimental values of 749 Kps for Li, Mg, K, Rb, Sr, Y, Cs, Ba, and REE (obtained from 91 individual experiments varying over five orders of magnitude) within a factor of 1.5 for 53 percent of the data and a factor of 2 for 74 percent of the data. The isothermal experimental data reveal that additional compositional effects, arising from non-ideal mixing in plagioclase and in melt, also influence Kp(i). A thermodynamic model based on the free energy of fusion of albite (NaAlSi3O8) and anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8), and taking into account plagioclase and melt non-ideality in Di-Ab-An, is developed to express Kp(Na), Kp(Ca) as functions of pressure (P), temperature (T) and composition (X). The thermodynamic models are extended to a wider compositional range by means of an empirical parameterization of 919 Kp(Na) and 920 Kp(Ca) from a database of 991 published experiments. These models are able to reproduce 919 measured partitioning values for Li, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Rb, Sr, Y, Cs, Ba, and REE (from 91 experiments) with 47 percent of the model values within a factor of 1.5 of the measured values and 69 percent within a factor of 2 for any P-T-X condition. The models can also be used to constrain the dependence of the chemical potential of trace cations in plagioclase solid solutions (μipl) for use in diffusion chronometry where the fully equilibrated trace element concentration profile must be known in order to calculate timescales. It is shown that μipl is not adequately described by existing empirical models used to predict Kp as a function of anorthite because of the conflating effects of T and X in the polythermal experimental datasets from which those models were derived.},

The ability of these minerals to acquire a strong and stable remanent magnetization in the presence of the Earth's magnetic field is determined to a large extent by their Curie temperature (Tc), saturation magnetization (Ms), coercivity (Hc), and remanence (Mrs). Tc and Ms). are determined mainly by the fundamental crystal chemical state of a mineral, which is effected by the processes of cation ordering, magnetic ordering, and subsolvus exsolution.

@article{Bennett:2019aa,
	abstract = {Textures and compositions of minerals can be used to infer the physiochemical conditions present within magmatic systems. Given that plagioclase is an abundant phase in many magmatic systems, understanding the link between texture and process is vital. Here, we present a database of textural and compositional data for > 1800 plagioclase crystals in mid-ocean ridge basalt from the Gakkel Ridge (Arctic Ocean) to investigate the physiochemical conditions and processes that govern the formation of plagioclase textures and compositions. The Gakkel basalts have high modal crystal contents (up to 50{\%}). The crystal cargo is complex, with both individual plagioclase and glomerocrysts showing large variations in crystal habit, zoning and resorption. The most common types of zoning are reverse and patchy; we attribute patchy zoning to infilling following either skeletal growth or resorption. Resorption is abundant, with multiple resorption events commonly present in a single crystal, and results from both magmatic recharge and decompression. Periods of strong undercooling, distinct to quench crystallisation, are indicated by matured skeletal crystals and thin normally zoned melt inclusion-rich bands following resorption. Individual samples often contain diverse textural and compositional plagioclase groups. Furthermore, most plagioclase is not in equilibrium with its host melt. Finally, the porous open structures of some glomerocrysts suggest that they represent pieces of entrained disaggregated mush. We interpret this to indicate that the crystal cargo is not generally phenocrystic in origin. Instead, plagioclase crystals that formed in different parts of a mush-dominated plumbing system were entrained into ascending melts. The textures of individual crystals are a function of their respective histories of (under)cooling, magma mixing and decompression. The morphologies of melt inclusion trapped in the plagioclase crystals are associated with specific host crystal textures, suggesting a link between plagioclase crystallisation processes and melt inclusion entrapment. The database of plagioclase presented herein may serve as a template for the interpretation of plagioclase textures in magmatic systems elsewhere.},

	abstract = {The single prism approximation SPA of the cluster variation method has been used to model the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition in hematite. This calculation yields insight into the accuracy of the SPA and other approximate methods for modeling order-disorder phenomena. Published values of the magnetic coupling constants were used to calculate the N{\'e}el temperature, sublattice magnetization, and magnetic specific heat. The calculated N{\'e}el temperature is found to be 1.21 times the observed value, as compared to 1.36 times observed for a mean field theory approximation, an improvement that reflects the superior treatment of configurational entropy in the SPA. Qualitative to semiquantitative agreement is obtained between observed and calculated values for sublattice magnetization and magnetic specific heat; however we find that previously published values for the magnetic specific heat are too large by a factor of two.},

	abstract = {{A theoretical model of equilibrium phase relations in the system Fe2O3--FeTiO3 is presented. This model is based on the single prism approximation in the cluster variation method and includes both chemical and magnetic contributions to the free energy of mixing. The inclusion of a magnetic degree of freedom and magnetic interaction parameters makes it possible to assess the effect of magnetic ordering on the compositions of coexisting titanhematite and hemoilmenite phases, and this effect is shown to be considerable. Two tricritical points are predicted to occur in the Fe2O3--FeTiO3 phase diagram: one at which an Fe--Ti order--disorder transition pierces the peak of a two-phase field; and a second at which the two phase field is intersected by an essentially antiferromagnetic transition. Below this latter point, the two-phase field is predicted to bulge out, towards Fe2O3, and it is argued that this feature should be useful in geothermometry.}},

@article{FIANNACCA2017302,
	abstract = {The late Variscan Serre Batholith in central Calabria represents the middle portion, c. 13-km-thick, of a tilted crustal section continuously exposed from lower-crustal granulites to upper-crustal phyllites. The batholith is zoned, consisting of several granitoid types that were emplaced at depths ranging from c. 23 to c. 6km. Deep, strongly foliated quartz diorites and tonalites were emplaced into migmatitic metapelites, the intermediate level granitoids are weakly foliated to unfoliated porphyritic granodiorites and monzogranites, and the shallowest bodies are two-mica granodiorites and granites, grading upward to biotite $\pm$ amphibole granodiorites, emplaced into paragneisses and phyllites. Five samples, representative of the main granitoid types in terms of both composition and emplacement depth, have been dated by SHRIMP. Zircon from a lower-crustal quartz diorite gave an emplacement age of 297.3$\pm$3.1Ma; two middle-crustal strongly peraluminous K-feldspar megacrystic granites were emplaced at 296.1$\pm$1.9Ma and 294.9$\pm$2.7Ma; a middle- to upper-crustal two-mica monzogranite was emplaced at 294.2$\pm$2.6Ma and finally, an upper-crustal weakly peraluminous granodiorite from the batholith roof was emplaced at 292.2$\pm$2.6Ma. These results are consistent with the development of the batholith by incremental multipulse overaccretion, each granitoid body being in a dominantly rigid state before intrusion of the next, with little or no possibility of magma mixing. The difference in age between the oldest and youngest granitoids, from the batholith floor and roof, respectively, is 5.1$\pm$4.0Ma, providing an upper limit of about 9Ma on the time taken for batholith construction. The presence in the c. 296--294Ma granitoids of c. 305--302Ma anatectic zircon with varied Th/U and oxygen isotope compositions indicates a time interval of 8--9Ma between incipient partial melting in the lower crust and magma emplacement in the middle crust. The emplacement of the first granitoid bodies into the top of the lower crust was controlled tectonically by the activation of a deep-seated shear zone. The shallowest granodiorites were emplaced during the waning stages of the shear zone activity, producing late- to post-tectonic contact metamorphism in the upper-crustal phyllites and mylonitic paragneisses.},

	abstract = {Earth's continental crust is primarily composed of buoyant, felsic igneous (granitic) material that has been extracted from the mantle along convergent plate margins. Establishing the timescales of subduction-related granite batholith assembly is key to understanding the processes of magma generation, segregation, and transport that define the dynamics and rates of crustal growth. The `Cordilleran' Bega Batholith is the largest I-type granite batholith in the Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB) of south-eastern Australia. The product of accretionary orogenesis along the Terra Australis Orogen, it has been extensively characterised by isotopic and geochemical studies yet lacks a robust geochronological framework. We present new ID-TIMS and SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages for twenty-two plutonic rocks of the Bega Batholith. This geochronological survey indicates a prolonged duration for I-type magmatism, with crystallisation ages ranging from ca. 420 Ma in the west, to 385 Ma in the eastern Bega Batholith. These I-type granites collectively occupy ∼90,000 km3 and were emplaced over a period of ∼20--35 Ma, corresponding to a magma production rate of ∼8--15 km3/Ma km−1, considerably lower than that of S-type granites of the region and other subduction-related granite terranes globally. Fundamentally, the temporal overlap between the Bega I-type granites and S- and A-type granites also argues against a hiatus between each phase of granite magmatism in the LFB, suggesting a continuum between the granite types and derivation from common source components. This new geochronological data provides the first comprehensive compilation of U-Pb ages from across the Bega Batholith, establishing initial constraints on the development and evolution of I-type magmatism in south-eastern Australia. Our results demonstrate that I-type granite petrogenesis is linked with crustal growth processes, requiring the modification of global crustal growth curves during the Phanerozoic to account for new continental crust generated within I-type granite terranes of the Paleo-Pacific Gondwanan margin.},

@article{GES20235.1,
	abstract = {{This paper presents a plate-scale model for the Precambrian growth and evolution of the North American continent. The core of the North American continent (Canadian shield) came together in the Paleoproterozoic (2.0--1.8 Ga) by plate collisions of Archean continents (Slave with Rae-Hearne, then Rae-Hearne with Superior) as well as smaller Archean continental fragments (Wyoming, Medicine Hat, Sask, Marshfield, Nain cratons). The resulting Trans-Hudson orogen was a collisional belt similar in scale to the modern Himalayas. It contains mainly reworked Archean crust, but remnants of juvenile volcanic belts are preserved between Archean masses. The thick, buoyant, and compositionally depleted mantle lithosphere that now underlies North America, although dominantly of Archean age, took its present shape by processes of collisional orogenesis and likely has a scale of mantle heterogeneity similar to that exhibited in the overlying crust.In marked contrast, lithosphere of southern North America (much of the conti nental United States) was built by progressive addition of a series of dominantly juvenile vol canic arcs and oceanic terranes accreted along a long-lived southern (present coordinates) plate margin. Early juvenile additions (Pembine-Wausau, Elves Chasmarcs) formed at the same time (1.84--1.82 Ga) the core was assembling. Following final assembly of the Archean and Paleoproterozoic core of North America by 1.8 Ga, major accretionary provinces (defined mainly by isotopic model ages) were added by arc-continent accretion, analogous to present-day convergence between Australia and Indonesia. Also similar to Indonesia, some accreted terranes contain older continental crustal material [Archean(?) Mojavia], but the extent and geometry of older crust are not well known. Accretionary provinces are composed of numerous 10 to 100 km scale terranes or blocks, separated by shear zones, some of which had compound histories as terrane sutures and later crustal-assembly structures. Major northeast-trending provinces are the Yavapai province (1.80--1.70 Ga), welded to North America during the 1.71--1.68 Ga Yavapai orogeny; the Mazatzal province (1.70--1.65 Ga), added during the 1.65--1.60 Ga Mazatzal orogeny; the Granite-Rhyolite province (1.50--1.30 Ga), added during the 1.45--1.30 Ga tectonic event associated with A-type intracratonic magmatism; and the Llano-Grenville province (1.30--1.00 Ga), added during the 1.30--0.95 Ga broader Grenville orogeny. During each episode of addition of juvenile lithosphere, the transformation of juvenile crust into stable continental lithosphere was facilitated by voluminous granitoid plutonism that stitched new and existing orogenic boundaries. Slab roll back created transient extensional basins (1.70 and 1.65 Ga) in which Paleoproterozoic quartzite-rhyolite successions were deposited, then thrust imbricated as basins were inverted. The lithospheric collage that formed from dominantly juvenile terrane accretion and stabilization (1.8--1.0 Ga) makes up about half of the present-day North American continent. Throughout (and as a result of) this long-lived convergent cycle, mantle lithosphere below the accretionary provinces was more hydrous, fertile, and relatively weak compared to mantle lithosphere under the Archean core.}},

@article{2017GC007344,
	abstract = {Abstract Recent sophisticated global data compilations and magnetic surveys have been used to investigate the nature of magnetization in the lower crust and upper mantle. Two approaches to constraining magnetizations are developed, providing minimum (0.01 SI) and maximum (0.04 SI) susceptibility estimates, given some assumed thickness (15+ km here). These values are higher than are found in many continental rocks. Are there rocks deeper in the crust or upper mantle that are more magnetic than expected, or are the model assumptions incomplete? What is the magnetic behavior of deep-crustal and upper mantle rocks, when slightly cooler than the Curie or N{\'e}el temperatures of their magnetic minerals, after being exhumed from locations of high-grade metamorphism at greater depth? Different sets of equilibrium metamorphic minerals can be considered that would form under different conditions. Results on 1,501 samples from the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) Norway, mainly from mafic and ultramafic bodies subducted to depths of 60--200 km and temperatures of 750 up to 950$\,^{\circ}$C at the very highest pressures, show that rocks did not fully equilibrate to the dominant metamorphic-facies conditions. There is a large variation in petrophysical properties, oxide minerals, and mineral assemblages in WGR samples, though they cannot explain the broad high-amplitude (deep-seated) anomalies measured in this region. The presence of magnetite, and exsolved titanohematite and hemoilmenite in samples, shows those magnetic phases are preserved even at eclogite-facies conditions, in part because complete eclogite-facies equilibrium was rarely achieved.},

@article{Okamoto:2023aa,
	abstract = {The slab--mantle interface in subduction zones is one of the geological boundaries with the most significant chemical potential gradients, which leads to fluid-mediated metasomatic reactions and chemical transport. As subducting sediment and basaltic crust often contain silica in various forms, the Si-metasomatism of mantle rocks is thought to occur along the subduction zone interface. However, growing evidence from the geochemistry of altered rocks and thermodynamic modelling has revealed the presence of multi-component fluids at the slab interface. Here, we review the laboratory experiments, geochemical models, and natural observations that improve our understanding of mass transport and metasomatic reactions at the crust--mantle interface, focusing on the relative mobility of Mg and Si. Hydrothermal experiments using analogues for the boundary between mantle (olivine) and crust (quartz or plagioclase) under vapor-saturated pressures indicate that Si is preferentially transported from crust to mantle, whereas Mg is immobile. This result is consistent with the distribution of talc rocks in oceanic lithosphere. On the other hand, at the contact between ultramafic (e.g., serpentinite) and crustal (pelitic schist or basaltic rocks) rocks in high-pressure metamorphic terranes, a large volume of chlorite rocks form in the crustal rocks, and the volume of chlorite often exceeds talc in serpentinites. Geochemical modeling reveals that in the shallow part of a subduction zone, the dissolved Si content of fluids in equilibrium with pelitic schist (CSi,crust) is significantly higher than the dissolved Mg content of fluids in equilibrium with mantle peridotite (CMg,mantle); however, CMg,mantle becomes dominant at depth, resulting in the Mg-metasomatism of crustal rocks to form chlorite rocks. This Mg-metasomatism is more widespread in warmer subduction zones (e.g., the Nankai and Cascadia subduction zones) than in colder subduction zones (e.g., in Northeast Japan). In addition, the infiltration of CO2-bearing fluid can form talc (along with carbonates) in ultramafic rocks without Si-metasomatism. Variations in the relative mobility of Si and Mg at the subduction zone interface produce variations in the overall solid volume change of mantle (expansion or contraction), the types of sheet silicates (talc versus chlorite), and the fluid budget (dehydration or hydration) during metasomatic reactions, which affects the pore fluid pressure, frictional strength of the subduction megathrust, and the location of seismicity around the mantle wedge corner.},

	abstract = {Carbonatites were discovered at Veseloe, North Transbaikalia, Russia in 2002. They are fluorapatite and calcite-bearing dolomite carbonatites and chemically classified as magnesiocarbonatites with high P, Ti, Cr and Ni. The Cr content in some parts of the Veseloe carbonatites is 3--4 times higher than average magnesiocarbonatite and results from the presence of partially resorbed polymineralic 3--5 mm diameter aggregates of Cr-rich minerals (magnetite, rutile, titanite, ilmenite, phengite, chlorite, chromite, titanite and talc). These aggregates may well be relict mantle xenoliths. They contain a rutile-magnetite intergrowth observed for the first time in nature and have compositions consistent with minerals from eclogite, kimberlite and mantle xenoliths. In the Veseloe carbonatites dolomite crystallized first, and then calcite, which is the inverse of the order of crystallization seen in most carbonatite complexes. Strontium isotope ratios are consistent with a Riphean mantle source. Carbon and O isotope ratios rule out some processes of alteration (metamorphic dehydration and high temperature hydrothermal alteration by meteoric waters) but do not plot in the accepted box for primary igneous carbonatite. Mineral geothermometers, inclusion measurements and the relict mantle xenoliths suggest petrogenesis by independent production of magnesiocarbonatite melt in the mantle rather than crustal differentiation of a carbonated-silicate parental melt.},

	abstract = {Abstract Exposures on Holsn{\o}y island (Bergen Arcs, Norway) indicate fluid infiltration through fractures into a dry, metastable granulite, which triggered a kinetically delayed eclogitization, a transient weakening during fluid-rock interaction, and formation of shear zones that widened during shearing. It remains unclear whether the effects of grain boundary-assisted aqueous fluid inflow on the duration of granulite hydration were influenced by a diffusional hydrogen influx accompanying the fluid inflow. To better estimate the fluid infiltration efficiencies and the parameter interdependencies, a 1D numerical model of a viscous shear zone is utilized and validated using measured mineral phase abundance distributions and H2O-contents in nominally anhydrous minerals of the original granulite assemblage to constrain the hydration by aqueous fluid inflow and diffusional hydrogen influx, respectively. Both hydrations are described with a diffusion equation and affect the effective viscosity. Shear zone kinematics are constrained by the observed shear strain and thickness. The model fits the phase abundance and H2O-content profiles if the effective hydrogen diffusivity is approximately one order of magnitude higher than the diffusivity for aqueous fluid inflow. The observed shear zone thickness is reproduced if the viscosity ratio between dry granulite and deforming, reequilibrating eclogite is ∼104 and that between dry granulite and hydrated granulite is ∼102. The results suggest shear velocities <10−2 cm/a, hydrogen diffusivities of ∼10−13$\pm$1 m2/s, and a shearing duration of <10 years. This study successfully links and validates field data to a shear zone model and highlights the importance of hydrogen diffusion for shear zone widening and eclogitization.},

	abstract = {Raman elastic geobarometry for mineral host-inclusion systems is used to determine the strains acting on an inclusion still entrapped in its host by measuring its Raman wavenumber shifts which are interpreted through the phonon-mode Gr{\"u}neisen tensors of the inclusion phase. The calculated inclusion strains can then be used in an elastic model to calculate the pressure and temperature conditions of entrapment. This method is applied frequently to host inclusion systems where the host is almost elastically isotropic (e.g. garnet) and the inclusion is elastically anisotropic (e.g. quartz and zircon). In this case, when the entrapment occurs under hydrostatic conditions the host will impose isotropic strains on the inclusion which in turn will develop non-hydrostatic stress. In this scenario the symmetry of the inclusion mineral is preserved and the strains in the inclusion can be measured via Raman spectroscopy using the phonon-mode Gr{\"u}neisen tensor approach. However, a more complex situation arises when the host-inclusion system is fully anisotropic, such as when a quartz inclusion is entrapped within a zircon host, because the symmetry of the inclusion can be broken due to the external anisotropic strain field imposed on the inclusion by the host, which in turn will modify the phonon modes. We therefore calculated the strain states of quartz inclusions entrapped in zircon hosts in multiple orientations and at various geologically relevant pressure and temperature conditions. We then performed ab initio Hartree-Fock/Density Functional Theory (HF/DFT) simulations on α-quartz in these strain states. These HF/DFT simulations show that the changes in the positions of the Raman modes produced by strains that are expected for symmetry broken quartz inclusions in zircon are generally similar to those that would be seen if the quartz inclusions remained truly trigonal in symmetry. Therefore, the use of the trigonal phonon-mode Gr{\"u}neisen tensor to determine the inclusion strains does not lead to geologically significant errors in calculated quartz inclusion entrapment pressures in zircon.},

	abstract = {The shape of chondrite normalized zircon rare earth element (REE) patterns, including the magnitude of the Cerium (Ce) and Europium (Eu) anomalies, provide valuable insights into the magmatic conditions under which a zircon formed. However, lanthanum (La) and praseodymium (Pr), which are essential for the calculation of Ce anomalies, are often present at concentrations close to or below the detection limit of most analytical methods. We propose two new methods to calculate missing REE, based on Onuma diagrams (Chondrite-Onuma) and the lattice strain theory (Chondrite-Lattice), but using chondrite normalized values instead of partition coefficients. We compiled a dataset of \~{} 1500 zircons with known REE + Y concentrations and used it to test and calibrate these methods and demonstrate that they are more accurate than other previously published models, with the Chondrite-Onuma method performing better than the Chondrite-Lattice method. These methods require analyses of as few as five REEs to impute the missing REE data or to estimate La and Pr concentrations or Ce anomalies in magmatic zircons, which allows a reduction in the number of REE analysed, where desirable, or to impute missing REEs in legacy data. The imputeREE package for the R programming language was written with a set of tools to apply these methods. A companion app is available to calculate missing REE and Ce and Eu anomalies.},

	abstract = {{Massive, nearly `pure', haemo-ilmenite layers from historic ore deposits in Rogaland, Norway contain very few silicates or other oxides and typically produce remanence-dominated magnetic anomalies. These rocks are ideal for evaluating the magnetic properties of fine exsolution intergrowths and the larger titanohaematite lamellae in the host ilmenite grains. A typical bulk composition, Ilm 84, exsolved at high temperature to produce host ilmenite Ilm 94 and micron-sized haematite lamellae Ilm 23 as measured by electron microprobe (EMP). Subsequent undercooling of the ilmenite and the micron-scale haematite lamellae led to metastable nucleation of nanoscale lamellae down to unit-cell scale, leaving depleted hosts between lamellae with compositions of Ilm 98 and Ilm 15--13 as measured by TEM--EDX. Samples have high coercivities, and average NRM values of 25 A m−1, which typically show ∼2 per cent saturation in the NRM state. The amount of magnetization in these samples is too high to be solely accounted for by a spin-canted AF moment in the haematite. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of haematite--ilmenite interfaces at the atomic scale and on measured rock-magnetic properties, we predict that the magnetization is carried by a ferrimagnetic substructure produced at the contacts of the very fine-scale titanohaematite and ilmenite exsolution lamellae.}},

@article{Becker:2002aa,
	abstract = {Experimental observations using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicate that Fe3+-rich grossular--andradite solid solutions with oscillatory zoning tend to occur as separate lamellae of andradite and intermediate compositions (Hirai and Nakazawa 1986; Pollok et al. 2001). From one lamella to the next, the Fe3+ concentration can change significantly within a few nm. In order to understand the Fe3+ and Al content of each phase and the thermodynamics, chemistry, structure, and stability at the interfaces, Monte Carlo simulations were performed. According to our calculations, there is an ordered structure with a 1:1 ratio of Al and Fe3+ with alternating Al and Fe octahedra along the main cubic crystallographic axes. Even though this ordered grandite is more energetically favorable than a 1:1 mixture of the end members grossular and andradite {$[$}by ≈1.6 kJ (mol exchangeable cations)−1{$]$}, this structure is stable only at temperatures below ≈500 K. Enthalpies, free energies, configurational and vibrational entropies of mixing, and the long-range order parameter are influenced by the formation of ordered grandite below 500 K. These data also explain why interfaces are stable only between grossular and grandite or between andradite and grandite but not between the end members. The interface energies between the end members and ordered grandite are comparably low {$[$}0.16 meV {\AA}−2∥(1 0 0), 0.55 meV {\AA}−2∥(1 1 0), 0.63 meV {\AA}−2∥(1 1 1){$]$} and, therefore, do not hinder the formation of lamellae. Our calculations on the free energies of mixing indicate that there are miscibility gaps between grossular and grandite and between grandite and andradite only below ≈430 K. Since most of these solid solutions are formed at higher temperatures for which we did not find evidence of a miscibility gap, the formation of compositional oscillations is probably due to kinetic hindering of thermodynamically stable complete solid solutions.  A new methodological aspect is the incorporation of zero-point energies of vibrations and the vibrational entropies into the calculation of the free energy of mixing. In case of the grossular--andradite solid solution, these vibrational effects change the free energy of mixing by only a few percent.},

	abstract = {The atomic scale structure and chemistry of (111) twins in MgAl2O4 spinel crystals from the Pinpyit locality near Mogok (Myanmar, formerly Burma) were analysed using complementary methods of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To obtain a three-dimensional information on the atomic structure, the twin boundaries were investigated in crystallographic projections {\$}{\$} {$[$}{$\backslash$}ifmmode{$\backslash$}expandafter{$\backslash$}bar{$\backslash$}else{$\backslash$}expandafter{$\backslash$}={$\backslash$}fi{\{}1{\}}10{$]$} {\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$} {$[$}11{$\backslash$}ifmmode{$\backslash$}expandafter{$\backslash$}bar{$\backslash$}else{$\backslash$}expandafter{$\backslash$}={$\backslash$}fi{\{}2{\}}{$]$}. {\$}{\$}Using conventional electron diffraction and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis we have shown that (111) twins in spinel can be crystallographically described by 180$\,^{\circ}$rotation of the oxygen sublattice normal to the twin composition plane. This operation generates a local hcp stacking in otherwise ccp lattice and maintains a regular sequence of kagome and mixed layers. In addition to rotation, no other translations are present in (111) twins in these spinel crystals. Chemical analysis of the twin boundary was performed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using a variable beam diameter (VBD) technique, which is perfectly suited for analysing chemical composition of twin boundaries on a sub-nm scale. The VBD/EDS measurements indicated that (111) twin boundary in spinel is Mg-deficient. Quantitative analyses of HRTEM (phase contrast) and HAADF-STEM (Z-contrast) images of (111) twin boundary have confirmed that Mg2+ ions are replaced with Be2+ ions in boundary tetrahedral sites. The Be-rich twin boundary structure is closely related to BeAl2O4 (chrysoberyl) and BeMg3Al8O16 (taaffeite) group of intermediate polysomatic minerals. Based on these results, we conclude that the formation of (111) twins in spinel is a preparatory stage of polytype/polysome formation (taaffeite) and is a result of thermodynamically favourable formation of hcp stacking due to Be incorporation on the {\{}111{\}} planes of the spinel structure in the nucleation stage of crystal growth. The twin structure grows as long as the surrounding geochemical conditions allow its formation. The incorporation of Be induces a 2D-anisotropy and exaggerated growth of the crystal along the (111) twin boundary.},

	abstract = {One-atmosphere experiments in the system diopside-albite-anorthite (Di-Ab-An) have been used to explore the controls on plagioclase-melt partitioning of trace elements (Li, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Zn, Sr, Ba, La, Sm, Y). By performing experiments along isotherms it was possible to isolate compositional controls from those of temperature. The lattice strain model accounts for variations in partition coefficients (Kp(i)) for isovalent series of cations (in+) and the experimental data are used to optimize the lattice strain parameters so that partition coefficients for n = 1 to 3 can be derived from Kp(Na), Kp(Ca), and Kp(La), respectively, at the conditions of interest. The optimized lattice strain parameters have magnitudes and compositional and thermal dependences that are consistent with elastic data for plagioclases. Kp(La) is parameterized via an exchange reaction involving CaAl2Si2O8 and the La-feldspar component. La0.5Na0.5Al2Si2O8. The free energy change of this reaction is small, but well constrained by the data, such that for a given P-T-X Kp(La) can be derived from a combination of Kp(Na) and Kp(Ca). In the case where Kp(Na) and Kp(Ca) are independently constrained, the models reproduce the experimental values of 749 Kps for Li, Mg, K, Rb, Sr, Y, Cs, Ba, and REE (obtained from 91 individual experiments varying over five orders of magnitude) within a factor of 1.5 for 53 percent of the data and a factor of 2 for 74 percent of the data. The isothermal experimental data reveal that additional compositional effects, arising from non-ideal mixing in plagioclase and in melt, also influence Kp(i). A thermodynamic model based on the free energy of fusion of albite (NaAlSi3O8) and anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8), and taking into account plagioclase and melt non-ideality in Di-Ab-An, is developed to express Kp(Na), Kp(Ca) as functions of pressure (P), temperature (T) and composition (X). The thermodynamic models are extended to a wider compositional range by means of an empirical parameterization of 919 Kp(Na) and 920 Kp(Ca) from a database of 991 published experiments. These models are able to reproduce 919 measured partitioning values for Li, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Rb, Sr, Y, Cs, Ba, and REE (from 91 experiments) with 47 percent of the model values within a factor of 1.5 of the measured values and 69 percent within a factor of 2 for any P-T-X condition. The models can also be used to constrain the dependence of the chemical potential of trace cations in plagioclase solid solutions (μipl) for use in diffusion chronometry where the fully equilibrated trace element concentration profile must be known in order to calculate timescales. It is shown that μipl is not adequately described by existing empirical models used to predict Kp as a function of anorthite because of the conflating effects of T and X in the polythermal experimental datasets from which those models were derived. {\copyright} 2014, Yale University.

	abstract = {This study describes textures and mineral chemistry of magnetite-ilmenite-bearing pods/pockets in mineralogically diverse feldspathic schist near Pathargora in the Singhbhum Shear Zone, eastern India. The textural and geochemical characteristics of the magnetite-ilmenite assemblage are the results of a protracted geological history involving magmatic crystallization and oxidation-exsolution of titanomagnetite, deformation-induced recrystallization and textural re-equilibration and hydrothermal fluid-induced hematitization of magmatic magnetite. The magnetite grains contain characteristic trellis and sandwich ilmenite lamella, which are interpreted to be the products of oxidation-exsolution of ulv{\"o}spinel component of magnetite-ulv{\"o}spinel solid solution. The exsolution process was accompanied by preferential partitioning of spinel elements such as Cr, Al and V in magnetite and Ti, Mn, Mg, HFS elements (Nb, Ta), transition elements (Sc, Co, Cu and Zn) and granitophile elements (Mo, Sn and W) in ilmenite. The deformed sandwich lamella is locally recrystallized and transformed into granular ilmenite close to fractures, micro-shear planes and magnetite grain boundaries. Coarse granules of ilmenite, within or associated with magnetite, are of two textural types: one invariably contains Fe-rich exsolved phase and may be of magmatic origin, while the other mostly formed by strain-induced, fluid-mediated expulsion (from the interior of magnetite to its boundary) and dynamic recrystallization of existing ilmenite lamella in magnetite, and dynamic recrystallization of primary ilmenite containing Fe-rich exsolved phases. Magnetite is variably hematitized. The highly porous nature and trace element geochemistry of hematite and mass-balance calculations suggest the hematitization was mostly redox-independent and was caused by infiltration of metal-rich, reduced and acidic fluid. The hematitization process was associated with significant enrichment and immobilization of U, Th, Pb, REEs, Cu, Mo and W and depletion of Ni, Cr, V in hematite.},

	abstract = {Mid-Proterozoic granulites in SW Sweden, having opaque minerals hematiteilmenite with minor magnetite, and occurring in an area with negative aeromagnetic anomalies, have strong and stable reversed natural remanent magnetization ∼9.2 A/m, with 100\% remaining after demagnetization to 100 mT. Samples were characterized by optical microscopy, electron microprobe (EMP), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and rock-magnetic measurements. Earliest oxide equilibrium was between grains of titanohematite and ferri-ilmenite at 650$\,^{\circ}$--600$\,^{\circ}$C. Initial contacts were modified by many exsolution cycles. Hematite and ilmenite (Ilm) hosts and lamellae by EMP are Ilm 24--25, ILm 88--93, like titanohematite, and ilmenite above 520$\,^{\circ}$C on Burton's diagram [1991]. Finer hosts and lamellae by TEM are Ilm16 $\pm$3 and Ilm 88$\pm$4, like coexisting antiferromagnetically ordered (AF) hematite and ilmenite below 520$\,^{\circ}$C on Burton's diagram. This may be the first example of analytical identification, in one sample, of former hematite, now finely exsolved, and AF hematite. TEM microstructures consist of gently curving semicoherent ilmenite lamellae within hematite, flanked by precipitate-free zones and abundant ilmenite disks down to unit cell scale (1--2 nm). Strain contrast of disks suggests full coherence with the host, and probable formation at the reaction titanohematite ---> AF hematite + ilmenite at 520$\,^{\circ}$C. Magnetic properties are a consequence of chemical and magnetic evolution of hematite and ilmenite with bulk compositions ilmenite-richer than Ilm 28, that apparently exsolved without becoming magnetized, down to 520$\,^{\circ}$C where hematite broke down to AF hematite plus ilmenite, producing abundant AF hematite below its N{\'e}el temperature. Intensity of magnetization is greater than possible with hematite alone, and TEM work suggests that ultrafine ilmenite disks in AF hematite are associated with a ferrimagnetic moment due to local imbalance of up and down spins at coherent interfaces.},

@article{KENDRICK2016356,
	abstract = {Orthopyroxene-oxide symplectites after olivine are among the most enigmatic features of corona assemblages in metagabbros. Two coronitic metagabbro bodies from the Algonquin suite in the Grenville Orogen, Ontario, contain exceptionally well preserved orthopyroxene+Fe--Ti oxide symplectite formed during prograde Ottawan (ca. 1060Ma) granulite-facies metamorphism. Based on textural evidence, we propose a new hypothesis for the formation of these symplectites. Under oxidising conditions associated with fluid infiltration, magmatic olivine and ilmenite underwent a coupled reaction whereby magnetite produced by oxidation of olivine replaced adjacent igneous ilmenite. Ilmenite was re-precipitated as a fine-grained intergrowth with orthopyroxene and some magnetite in the former olivine sites. This hypothesis is supported by textural evidence showing partial replacement of magmatic ilmenite by magnetite and a close spatial association between magmatic oxides and orthopyroxene+Fe--Ti oxide symplectite, which locally radiates from ilmenite into olivine. Measured orthopyroxene/oxide ratios in the symplectite (20--35\% oxides) agree with the ratio predicted from the proposed reaction (ca. 30\%). Coronas and pseudomorphs formed during high-grade metamorphism, with increasing fO2 interpreted to result from fluid infiltration at near-peak conditions of ca. 13kbar, 800$\,^{\circ}$C. The same samples contain red-brown fine-grained aggregates interpreted as iddingsite pseudomorphs after olivine. Raman spectroscopy suggests that the iddingsite consists largely of amorphous silica and Fe-hydroxide; textural evidence indicates that it formed by late-stage oxidation and hydration of olivine that survived earlier metamorphism. The unusual co-occurrence of granulite-facies pseudomorphs after olivine with an alteration product formed at near-surface conditions indicates that some olivine may survive protracted high-grade metamorphism in environments where fluid access is limited.},

	abstract = {Granitic rocks (sensu lato) are a major rock type in orogenic belts. The crystallization pressures of granitic rocks can help to unravel the magmatic processes and tectonic evolution of these regions, particularly in areas where metamorphic rocks are not exposed. However, geobarometric techniques that are suitable for granitoids are quite limited. In this study, we propose a new approach to estimate crystallization pressures of granitoid magmas using melt inclusions in zircon, a ubiquitous accessory mineral in these lithologies. Homogenization experiments of polymineralic inclusions hosted in zircon have been conducted from a biotite granite sample in the Miocene Miuchi pluton, southwest Japan arc, using a piston-cylinder high-pressure--high-temperature apparatus. The homogenized compositions of the inclusions have high SiO2 contents (76--80 wt\%) implying that they represent fractionated interstitial melts trapped in growing zircon crystals. The rhyolite-MELTS geobarometer for the homogenized melt inclusions in oscillatory-zoned zircon rim yields pressures ranging from 80 to 114 MPa (with error of $\pm$25 MPa), interpreted as the crystallization pressures of the Miuchi pluton. These results are consistent with field and petrographic observations suggestive of a shallow emplacement level. The approach presented here would be applicable to most granitoids, which could provide fundamental data to better understand granite petrogenesis and the tectonic evolution of orogenic belts.},

	abstract = {The major and trace element compositions of nine eclogites from the Dabie--Sulu ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic terrane in eastern China were determined for both whole rock and the main constituent minerals, garnet and clinopyroxene. The results indicate that the eclogite protoliths originated from a basaltic magma, which formed in a continental setting as shown by isotopic and immobile element data. Based on the garnet REE characteristics, the eclogites can be roughly divided into two groups. Group 1 has LREE enrichment with no Eu anomaly for whole rock, and smooth LREE depletion but HREE enrichment pattern for garnet, whereas group 2 shows a depletion of LREE with a pronounced positive Eu anomaly and flat HREE pattern for both whole rock and garnet. From these features, we suggest that the protoliths for group 2 are Fe--Ti--gabbros with relatively high cumulus plagioclase and Fe--Ti oxide, whereas the group 1 eclogites are probably from basalts. Therefore, the unusual garnet REE pattern observed in group 2 can be considered as an important signature for identifying gabbro protoliths for eclogites. The identification of gabbro protoliths from the eclogites in the Dabie--Sulu terrane provides evidence for Neoproterozoic rift magmatism in the northern margin of the Yangtze craton. During ultrahigh pressure metamorphism in the Dabie--Sulu terrane, LILEs (including Ba, Rb, Th, U, K) had high mobility, but REEs and HFSEs were immobile, and trace element distribution equilibrium was approached between garnet and clinopyroxene. An estimate of mass balance indicates that garnet and clinopyroxene host the majority of HREEs and Y, and clinopyroxene is a significant host for Sr, but minor and accessory minerals predominantly account for LREEs, Th, U, and Zr.},

	abstract = {{Magnetic mineralogy of crustal rocks has important implications for understanding continental crustal evolution and origin of regional magnetic anomalies. However, magnetic properties of the deep continental crust are still poorly understood. In this paper, measurements of density (ρ), mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (χ), natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and magnetic hysteresis loops, temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χ--T), chemical and mineral analyses were conducted on Archean gneiss samples from the Jixian petrophysical section in the Precambrian terrain, northeastern North China Craton, with the aim of refining understanding of magnetic phase transformations in the deep crustal rocks. Results show that density and rock magnetic properties change distinctly with metamorphic facies. The dominant magnetic mineral is magnetite, while a little hematite is present in a few samples. Together with geochemical and mineralogical compositions, it is inferred that progressive increase in metamorphic grade from east to west is the major cause for magnetic enhancement of the lower crust in the studied section. Therefore, we conclude that study of magnetic phases of deep crustal rocks can offer important insights into the history of high metamorphic grade terranes.}},

	abstract = {A data set of room temperature magnetic parameters for several iron oxides and sulphides was compiled from the available literature. The aim was to propose the most effective methods for assessing mineralogy, concentration and domain state within environmental magnetic studies. Establishing the magnetic mineralogy is essential for a correct interpretation of concentration and grain-size indicative parameters. Hematite and in particular goethite are recognised by their high (remanent) coercivities. The ratio of saturation remanent magnetisation to susceptibility is suited for assessing mineralogy; for low coercivity minerals, high values of the ratio are indicative of pyrrhotite. Greigite and maghemite both have intermediate ratios, while very low values suggest the presence of (titano)magnetite. From the concentration-dependent parameters mass specific susceptibility, saturation remanent magnetisation and susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetisation, susceptibility displayed the least grain-size dependence. Therefore, it is perhaps the best indicator of concentration, under the proviso of uniform mineralogy and when paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions are taken into consideration. All minerals showed a decrease in coercivity and remanence ratios with increasing grain size for sizes larger than one micrometer. In contrast, the coercivity of goethite showed an increase with grain size. Assessment of domain state was complicated by very small and large grains displaying similar magnetic properties.},

	abstract = {The high Fe-Ti eclogites with exsolved lamellar in 530--600 m depths from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) main hole in the Sulu Ultra-High Pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt, eastern China, record an anomalously high susceptibility (κ), natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and K{\"o}enigsberger ratio Q (NRM/Ji, Ji is induced magnetization). This provides us with a good opportunity to study the effects of magnetic minerals and exsolution lamellae on the magnetic properties of deep rocks. In this paper, we have measured systematically magnetic properties and mineral assemblage and structure for three special samples (No. 83, No.86 and No.89). Results show that these Fe-Ti-rich eclogites are the result of the fine-grained (titano)-magnetite exsolution in pyroxene and lamellar structure consisting of finely interlayered ilmenite and hematite in exsolved hemo-ilmenite. We found that the dominant Fe-bearing oxide minerals in samples studied are ilmenite, hematite (Hem + Ilm up to 25\%), little (titano)magnetite and pyrite. The ferromagnetic susceptibility is mainly controlled by fine grained (titano)magnetite and NRM is closely related to the exsolved lamellar structure. We hence propose that the anomalous magnetism of these eclogites observed in our samples is the result of exsolution from homogenous pyroxene and ilmeno-hematite during cooling and decompression processes. These Fe-Ti-rich eclogites might be one of the sources of high-magnetic anomalies observed in the Sulu subduction zone, eastern China.},

@article{Horsburgh:2023aa,
	abstract = {Fluorite is one of the most common minerals in the crust and is of widespread economic importance. It shows strong UV-excited luminescence, variously attributed to defects within the fluorite structure and lanthanide substitutions. We present here a detailed chemical characterisation of a suite of natural fluorite samples, chosen to represent the range of compositions observed in nature. We perform X-ray excited luminescence spectroscopy on the samples as a function of temperature (20--673 K) in the wavelength range 250--800 nm to provide insights into physical defects in the lattice and their interactions with lanthanide substituents in natural fluorite. Most broad bands in the UV are attributed to electronic defects in the fluorite lattice, whereas sharp emissions are attributed to intra-ion energy cascades in trivalent lanthanides. Lanthanides are accommodated in fluorite by substitution for Ca2+ coupled with interstitial F−, O2−(substituting for F−) and a variety of electronic defect structures which provide local charge balance. The chondrite-normalised lanthanide profiles show that fluorite accommodates a greater proportion of heavy lanthanides (and Y) as the total Rare Earth Element (REE) concentration increases; whereas cell parameters decrease and then increase as substitution continues. Luminescence intensity also goes through a maximum and then decreases as a function of REE concentration. All three datasets are consistent with a model whereby lanthanides initially act as isolated centres, but, beyond a critical threshold (\~{} 1000 ppm), cluster into lanthanide-rich domains. Clustering results in shorter REE-O bond distances (favouring smaller heavier ions), a larger unit cell but more efficient energy transfer between lanthanides, thereby promoting non-radiative energy loss and a drop in the intensity of lanthanide emission.},

	abstract = {Fluids derived from the devolatilization of subducting slabs play a critical role in the melting of the mantle wedge and global geochemical cycles. However, in spite of evidence for the existence and mobility of an aqueous fluid phase during subduction metamorphism, the effect of this fluid on decarbonation reactions in subducting lithologies remains largely unquantified. In this study we present results from thermodynamic modeling of metamorphic devolatilization of subducted lithologies for pressures up to 6 GPa using an approach which considers fluid fractionation from source lithologies and infiltration from subjacent lithologies. This open system approach in which fluid flow is an intrinsic component of the chemical model offers an alternative to closed system models of subduction zone decarbonation. In general, our models simulating pervasive fluid flow in subducting lithologies predict CO2 fluxes measured from volcanic arcs more closely than models which assume purely channelized flow. Despite the enhanced effect of H2O-rich fluid infiltration on subduction decarbonation, our results support the hypothesis that CO2 is returned to the deep mantle at convergent margins, particularly in cool and intermediate subduction zones. Our results demonstrate that for most subduction zones, a significant proportion of the CO2 derived from the slab is lost beneath the fore arc, and therefore CO2 flux estimates based on measurements within the volcanic arc alone may significantly underestimate the slab-derived CO2 flux for individual margins. Nevertheless, our predicted global slab-derived CO2 flux from convergent margins of 0.35--3.12 × 1012 mols CO2/yr is in good agreement with previous estimates of global arc volcanic flux. Because our predicted global slab-derived CO2 flux is significantly less than atmospheric CO2 drawdown by chemical weathering, significant CO2 emission from other geologic regimes (e.g., hot spots) would be required to balance the global carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Recent studies on metamorphic petrology as well as microstructural observations suggest the influence of mechanical effects upon chemically active metamorphic minerals. Thus, the understanding of such a coupling is crucial to describe the dynamics of geomaterials. In this effort, we derive a thermodynamically consistent framework to characterize the evolution of chemically active minerals. We model the metamorphic mineral assemblages as a solid-species solution where the species mass transport and chemical reaction drive the stress generation process. The theoretical foundations of the framework rely on modern continuum mechanics, thermodynamics far from equilibrium, and the phase-field model. We treat the mineral solid solution as a continuum body, and following the Larch{\'e}and Cahn network model, we define displacement and strain fields. Consequently, we obtain a set of coupled chemo-mechanical equations. We use the aforementioned framework to study single minerals as solid solutions during metamorphism. Furthermore, we emphasise the use of the phase-field framework as a promising tool to model complex multi-physics processes in geoscience. Without loss of generality, we use common physical and chemical parameters found in the geoscience literature to portrait a comprehensive view of the underlying physics. Thereby, we carry out 2D and 3D numerical simulations using material parameters for mineral solid solutions to showcase and verify the chemo-mechanical interactions of mineral solid solutions that undergo spinodal decomposition, chemical reactions, and deformation.},

	abstract = {Abstract The tool of phase-field modeling for the prediction of chemical as well as microstructural evolution during crystallization from a melt in a mineralogical system has been developed in this work. We provide a compact theoretical background and introduce new aspects such as the treatment of anisotropic surface energies that are essential for modeling mineralogical systems. These are then applied to two simple model systems---the binary olivine-melt and plagioclase-melt systems - to illustrate the application of the developed tools. In one case crystallization is modeled at a constant temperature and undercooling while in the other the process of crystallization is tracked for a constant cooling rate. These two examples serve to illustrate the capabilities of the modeling tool. The results are analyzed in terms of crystal size distributions (CSD) and with a view toward applications in diffusion chronometry; future possibilities are discussed. The modeling results demonstrate that growth at constant rates may be expected only for limited extents of crystallization, that breaks in slopes of CSD-plots should be common, and that the lifetime of a given crystal of a phase is different from the lifetime of this phase in a magmatic system. The last aspect imposes an inherent limit to timescales that may be accessed by diffusion chronometry. Most significantly, this tool provides a bridge between CSD analysis and diffusion chronometry---two common tools that are used to study timescales of magmatic processes.},

	abstract = {Abstract The ``Day'' diagram (Day et al., 1977, https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-9201(77)90108-X) is used widely to make inferences about the domain state of magnetic mineral assemblages. Based on theoretical and empirical arguments, the Day diagram is demarcated into stable ``single domain'' (SD), ``pseudo single domain'' (``PSD''), and ``multidomain'' (MD) zones. It is straightforward to make the necessary measurements for a sample and to plot results within the ``domain state'' framework based on the boundaries defined by Day et al. (1977, https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-9201(77)90108-X). We discuss 10 issues that limit Day diagram interpretation, including (1) magnetic mineralogy, (2) the associated magnetocrystalline anisotropy type, (3) mineral stoichiometry, (4) stress state, (5) surface oxidation, (6) magnetostatic interactions, (7) particle shape, (8) thermal relaxation, (9) magnetic particle mixtures, and (10) definitional/measurement issues. In most studies, these variables are unknowns and cannot be controlled for, so that hysteresis parameters for single bulk samples are nonunique and any data point in a Day diagram could result from infinite combinations of relevant variables. From this critical appraisal, we argue that the Day diagram is fundamentally ambiguous for domain state diagnosis. Widespread use of the Day diagram has also contributed significantly to prevalent but questionable views, including underrecognition of the importance of stable SD particles in the geological record and reinforcement of the unhelpful PSD concept and of its geological importance. Adoption of approaches that enable correct domain state diagnosis should be an urgent priority for component-specific understanding of magnetic mineral assemblages and for quantitative rock magnetic interpretation.},

	abstract = {Abstract First-order reversal curve (FORC) diagrams of synthetic binary mixtures with single-domain, vortex state, and multidomain end-members (EMs) were analyzed using principal component analysis (FORC-PCA). Mixing proportions derived from FORC-PCA are shown to deviate systematically from the known weight percent of EMs, which is caused by the lack of reversible magnetization contributions to the FORC distribution. The error in the mixing proportions can be corrected by applying PCA to the raw FORCs, rather than to the processed FORC diagram, thereby capturing both reversible and irreversible contributions to the signal. Here we develop a new practical implementation of the FORC-PCA method that enables quantitative unmixing to be performed routinely on suites of FORC diagrams with up to four distinct EMs. The method provides access not only to the processed FORC diagram of each EM, but also to reconstructed FORCs, which enables objective criteria to be defined that aid identification of physically realistic EMs. We illustrate FORC-PCA with examples of quantitative unmixing of magnetic components that will have widespread applicability in paleomagnetism and environmental magnetism.},

	abstract = {The R3¯ to R3¯c cation-ordering phase transition in the ilmenite (FeTiO3)--hematite (Fe2O3) solid solution has been studied at high temperature and pressure using in-situ time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction. Experiments were performed on a synthetic sample of (FeTiO3)0.65(Fe2O3)0.35 at T≤933$\,^{\circ}$C and P≤1.1GPa using an internally heated Paris--Edinburgh cell. The degree of cation order is observed to increase significantly with pressure. Thermodynamic analysis reveals an increase in the transition temperature from 911$\,^{\circ}$C at atmospheric pressure to 1010$\,^{\circ}$C at P=0.64GPa. This increase is much larger than that predicted on the basis of the volume change for the transition, indicating that the pressure dependence of cation ordering is dominated by enhanced cation--cation interaction, and not by volume strain. We predict an increase in the eutectoid temperature of up to 150$\,^{\circ}$C at 1GPa. This implies that intergrowths of antiferromagnetic hematite and paramagnetic ilmenite could be stable at temperatures up to 540$\,^{\circ}$C at 1GPa and cannot be ruled out as a potential source of lower crustal magnetization.},

@article{Enami:1994aa,
	abstract = {Sodic pyroxene (jadeite content Xjd=0.1--0.3) occurs locally as small inclusions within, albite porphyroblasts and in the matrix of hematite-bearing quartz schists in the Sanbagawa (Sambagawa) metamorphic belt, central Shikoku, Japan. The sodic, pyroxene-bearing samples are characteristically free from chlorite and their typical mineral assemblage is sodic pyroxene+subcalcic (or sodic) amphibole+phengitic mica+albite+quartz+hematite+titanite$\pm$epidote. Spessartine-rich garnet occurs in Mn-rich samples. Sodic pyroxene in epidote-bearing samples tends to be poorer in acmite content (average XAcm=0.26--0.50) than that in the epidote-free samples (XAcm=0.45--0.47). XJd shows no systematic relationship to metamorphic grade, and is different among the three sampling regions {$[$}Saruta-gawa, Asemi-gawa and Bessi (Besshi){$]$}. The average XJd of the Saruta-gawa samples (0.21--0.29) is higher than that of the Asemi-gawa (0.13--0.17) and Bessi (0.14--0.23). The P-T conditions of the Asemi-gawa and Bessi regions are estimated at 5.5--6.5 kbar, >360$\,^{\circ}$C in the chlorite zone, 7--8.5 kbar, 440$\pm$15$\,^{\circ}$C in the garnet zone and 8--9.5 kbar, 520$\pm$25$\,^{\circ}$C in the albite-biotite zone. Metamorphic pressure of the Saruta-gawa region is systematically 1--1.5 kbar higher than that of the Asemi-gawa and Bessi regions, and materials of the Saruta-gawa region have been subducted to a level 3--5 km deeper than materials that underwent metamorphism at equivalent temperatures and are now exposed in the Asemi-gawa and Bessi regions. Pressure slightly increases toward the north (structurally high levels) through the Sanbagawa belt of central shikoku. Two types of zonal structure were observed in relatively coarse-grained sodic pyroxenes in the matrix. One type is characterized by increasing XJd from core to rim, the other type by decreasing XJd from core to rim. Both types of zoned pyroxenes show an increase in XFe2+{$[$}=Fe2+/(Fe2++Mg){$]$} from core to rim. The first type of zoning was observed in a sample from the chlorite zone of lowest grade, whereas the latter occurs in the garnet and albite-biotite zones of higher grade. The contrast in zonal structure implies that dP/dT during prograde metamorphism decreased with increasing metamorphic grade and may have been negative in some samples from the higher-grade zones. The estimated dP/dT of the prograde stage of the chlorite zone is 3.2 kbar/100$\,^{\circ}$C, and that of the garnet and albite-biotite zones is -1.8 to 0.9 kbar/100$\,^{\circ}$C. The variation of dP/dT at shallow and deep levels of a subduction system probably reflects the difference of heating duration and/or change in thermal gradient of the subduction zone by continuous cooling of the surrounding mantle.},

	abstract = {The oligoclase-biotite zone of the Bessi area, central Shikoku is characterized by sodic plagioclase (XCa= 0.10--0.28)-bearing assemblages in pelitic schists, and represents the highest-grade zone of the Sanbagawa metamorphic terrain. Mineral assemblages in pelitic schists of this zone, all with quartz, sodic plagioclase, muscovite and clinozoisite (or zoisite), are garnet + biotite + chlorite + paragonite, garnet + biotite + hornblende + chlorite, and partial assemblages of these two types. Correlations between mineral compositions, mineral assemblages and mineral stability data assuming PH2O = Psolid suggests that metamorphic conditions of this zone are about 610 $\pm$ 25$\,^{\circ}$C and 10 $\pm$ 1 kbar. Based upon a comparative study of mineralogy and chemistry of pelitic schists in the oligoclase-biotite zone of the Sanbagawa terrain with those in the New Caledonia omphacite zone as an example of a typical high-pressure type of metamorphic belt and with those in a generalized`upper staurolite zone'as an example of a medium-pressure type of metamorphic belt, progressive assemblages within these three zones can be related by reactions such as:},

	abstract = {{The coarsening of the coherent lamellar microstructure in a high sanidine-high albite cryptoperthite of Or35 bulk composition was determined experimentally between 560$\,^{\circ}$ and 470$\,^{\circ}$C. The lamellar spacing (λ) was measured by transmission electron microscopy. It increases as a function of the isothermal annealing time (t) and is expressed by λ = λ0 + kt1/3, where k is a rate constant and λ0 is the initial lamellar spacing. The maximum temperature for the development of this microstructure is about 570$\,^{\circ}$C, and the lowest temperature practical for experimental study is about 470$\,^{\circ}$C where the lamellae coarsen only 60A/year. Annealing times were for ≤548 days and the experiments were done dry at one atmosphere. An experiment at 560$\,^{\circ}$C and a water pressure of 2 kbar yielded a similar result to the dry experiments. The kinetic data are summarized by k (A/day1/3) = 1.78 × 108 exp (−25000/RT) where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. These data predict an increase in the lamellar spacing of 5500A for exsolution starting at 560$\,^{\circ}$C and a linear cooling rate of 0.01 degree/year. The potential application of these kinetic data to cryptoperthites in volcanic and shallow intrusive rocks is considered; one of the most important factors is the size of the initial lamellar spacing in natural samples.}},

	abstract = {{Mg-rich diopsides on the Mg2Si2O6-CaMgSi2Oe join were synthesized from glasses or gels and subsequently annealed at atmospheric pressure between 1000$\,^{\circ}$ and 1350$\,^{\circ}$С for varying lengths of time. A marked change in the exsolution kinetics was observed at 1325$\,^{\circ}$C for Di54.1 and at 1275$\,^{\circ}$C for Di63.3. Below these temperatures the respective compositions exsolve rapidly (in one day or less), and the resulting microstructure, observed by transmission electron microscopy, consists of closely-spaced, irregular lamellae parallel to (001). Above 1325$\,^{\circ}$C (for Di54.1) and 1275$\,^{\circ}$C (for Di63.3) no exsolution was observed after equivalent or longer annealing times. In addition, no exsolution occurred for a composition of Di71.5 annealed at temperatures as low as 1000$\,^{\circ}$C for 144 hours.A microstructure consisting of straight widely-spaced lamellae, also parallel to (001), was observed in long-term runs of Di68.4 annealed at 1125$\,^{\circ}$C for several hundred hours; however, the method of synthesis was different from that used for the other compositions and may have introduced chemical inhomogeneities into the starting material. In all cases the exsolved phase is perfectly coherent with the host, but inverts to low pigeonite during cooling. Because of the coherency between the phases, the exsolution must occur beneath the coherent solvus, and the sharp break in the kinetics is attributed to the (001) coherent spinodal.}},

	abstract = {{The R3̅ to R3̅c cation ordering phase transition in the ilmenite (FeTiO3) -- hematite (Fe2O3) solid solution has been investigated using in-situ time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction. Four synthetic samples of the solid solution containing 70, 80, 90, and 100\\% FeTiO3 (ilm70, ilm80, ilm90, and ilm100, respectively) were heated under vacuum to a maximum of 1350 $\,^{\circ}$C. Powder diffraction patterns were collected at several temperatures on heating and cooling, with a Rietveld refinement performed in each case. Samples ilm80, ilm90, and ilm100 were fully ordered after quenching from the synthesis temperature to room temperature. Sample ilm70 had a higher degree of quenched in disorder, which is the result of chemical heterogeneities produced during quenching and subsequent heating in the neutron experiments. The degree of order in all samples decreased smoothly at high temperatures, with second-order transitions to the R3̅c phase being observed at 1000, 1175, and 1325 $\,^{\circ}$C in ilm70, ilm80, and ilm90, respectively. The transition temperature in ilm100 was higher than the maximum temperature reached in the neutron experiments, and is estimated as ~1400 $\,^{\circ}$C. The character of the transition is typical of that predicted by three-dimensional Ising models and appears to become more first-order in character with increasing Ti-content. The temperature-dependence of the cell parameters reveals that components of the spontaneous strain tensor, e11 and e33, are negative and positive, respectively. Little volume strain is associated with long-range ordering. A small negative volume strain due to short-range ordering within the R3̅c phase is identified. The variations in cell parameters and cation-cation distances can be understood in terms of the competing effects of long- and short-range ordering as a function of temperature and composition.}},

	abstract = {{The transition temperature (Tc) between disordered, R3¯C, and ordered, R3¯, ilmenite-hematite solid solutions in the ferrian ilmenite composition range between Ilm60 and Ilm80 has been redetermined by observing the presence or absence of transition-induced cation-ordered domains and the behavior of pre-existing domains annealed below the transition. The transition was reversed for Ilm70 and is bracketed between 1000 and 1050 $\,^{\circ}$C. The domains were shown by dark-field transmission electron microscopy to be twin related by a 180$\,^{\circ}$ rotation about an axis parallel to a and to vary in size depending on Tc and the temperature of quench.A model of the twin-domain boundary indicates that such boundaries are disordered and partially Fe-enriched. Magnetic tem and observations on the same samples show that the room-temperature saturation magnetization is related to the surface area of the twin boundaries. Because the cation-ordered domains are ferrimagnetic with a strong magnetic moment and the disordered boundaries are probably antiferromagnetic with a weak magnetic moment, the quenched samples are essentially mixtures of two magnetic phases. The magnetization is therefore related to the proportion of each phase.The twin boundaries act as the classic ``x'' phase, which allows ferrian ilmenite to acquire a self-reversed thermoremanent magnetization (trm). Our measurements indicate that when the surface area of the twin boundaries in Ilm70 exceeds approximately 25 x 106 m2/m3, the quenched samples acquire reverse trm during cooling in a 0.5-Oe field. When the boundary surface area is less than this critical threshold, the quenched samples acquire a normal trm.}},

	abstract = {A new mineralogic geothermometer based on the partitioning of Fe and Mn between garnet and ilmenite has been calibrated by reversal experiments in the P-T range 600--900$\,^{\circ}$C, 2 and 5 kbars and for fO2=QFM. The results constitute a sensitive geothermometer applicable over a broad range of composition and conditions. Garnetilmenite thermometry has advantages relative to existing geothermometers because of its accurate calibration, marked temperature sensitivity and the chemical and structural simplicity of the crystalline solutions involved. Application to natural assemblages reveals that the garnet-ilmenite geothermometer yields temperatures that agree well with other estimates. The reactivity of, and relatively rapid Fe-Mn diffusion in ilmenite may lead to retrograde resetting of high temperature partition values, but these factors may be useful for estimating rock cooling rates. Analysis of the experimental data indicates minor positive deviations from ideality for Fe-Mn garnets and ilmenites. Absolute magnitudes of interaction parameters (WAB) derived from a regression analysis are subject to considerable uncertainty. The partition coefficient is, however, strongly dependent on the difference between solution parameters. These differences are well constrained with a magnitude of WFeMnilm−WFeMngar≃300 cal mol−1. The accuracy and applicability of garnet-ilmenite thermometry will improve with the availability of better thermodynamic data for garnet crystalline solutions.},

	abstract = {U--Pb ages of detrital zircons in clastic sediments are potential indicators of sedimentary provenance and crustal evolution. To extract geologically significant information from such data, it is necessary that the zircons analysed in the laboratory reflect the sediment from which they were separated. Among other factors, this depends on the number of grains analysed. The probability that a detrital zircon in a sediment belongs to one of several populations (defined by their age or another well-defined parameter) is described by the binomial probability formula, from which detection limits and expected values for the accuracy and precision of population sizes can be derived. Monte Carlo simulation of sets of data with up to 120 individual analyses drawn from pools with known age probability density distributions shows that quantitative representation of the age distribution of the zircons in the host sediment is unlikely to be achieved in natural cases. Methods that assume such representation (e.g., age spectrum deconvolution, multivariate statistical analysis using probability density scores, and mass balance modelling) are therefore likely to give results of questionable significance. The best way to extract the potential information contained in detrital zircons may be a combination of random and nonrandom selection of grains for analysis; yielding two complementary sets of age data from each sample, the random fraction should comprise 35--70 grains or more, depending on the complexity of the age distribution. The use of trace element and Lu--Hf isotope data from the zircons dated by U--Pb will give additional, valuable information, which may facilitate interpretation of detrital zircon ages. The use of detrital zircon ages to limit the age of deposition of the host sediment is fraught with both geological and statistical sources of error, and is therefore discouraged.},

@article{Clavijo:2021aa,
	abstract = {At high temperature and pressure, solid diffusion and chemical reactions between rock minerals lead to phase transformations. Chemical transport during uphill diffusion causes phase separation, that is, spinodal decomposition. Thus, to describe the coarsening kinetics of the exsolution microstructure, we derive a thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for the multicomponent Cahn--Hilliard equations while accounting for multiple chemical reactions and neglecting deformations. Our approach considers multiple balances of microforces augmented by multiple component content balance equations within an extended Larch{\'e}--Cahn framework. As for the Larch{\'e}--Cahn framework, we incorporate into the theory the Larch{\'e}--Cahn derivatives with respect to the phase fields and their gradients. We also explain the implications of the resulting constrained gradients of the phase fields in the form of the gradient energy coefficients. Moreover, we derive a configurational balance that includes all the associated configurational fields in agreement with the Larch{\'e}--Cahn framework. We study phase separation in a three-component system whose microstructural evolution depends upon the reaction--diffusion interactions and to analyze the underlying configurational fields. This simulation portrays the interleaving between the reaction and diffusion processes and how the configurational tractions drive the motion of interfaces.},

	abstract = {Phase separation in a binary system that results from the uphill diffusion of chemical components is investigated theoretically. We reconsider the original spinodal decomposition model of Cahn and Hilliard taking into account possible intrinsic anisotropy of the underlying system. Specifically we address the effects of orientation dependent interfacial energy. Such anisotropy is of particular importance for mineral systems. The corresponding evolution equation is systematically derived. We show how the anisotropy affects the interfacial energy per unit area, the interface width, scaling laws, and the critical system size at which spinodal decomposition starts to develop. We further obtain numerical solutions and discuss coarsening dynamics for the case where the decomposition products have pronounced shape anisotropy.},

	abstract = {A reliable prediction of phase relations in mineral systems is central to geochemical research. As demonstrated in the foregoing chapters, a thermodynamic dataset based exclusively on calorimetry seldom allows computation of phase diagrams sufficiently accurate for geochemical applications. Nevertheless, calorimetry is, and will remain, the fundamental source of thermodynamic data, even if such data need to be fine-tuned for further use. The preceding chapters have also taught us that reaction reversals are effective constraints for calorimetric data. Thus, a combination of reversal brackets and calorimetry must give us a thermodynamic dataset best suited to accomplish our goal of computing precise phase diagrams. A thermodynamic dataset, compatible with calorimetry and reaction reversals alike, is called an internally consistent thermodynamic dataset.},

@article{10.2307/30061145,
	abstract = {A technique has been devised for evaluating the internal consistency of experimental data in any particular chemical system. The sequence of steps is: (1) Each experimental point is expressed as an inequality in terms of the free energy change of the reaction to which it applies. For example, in a solid-solid reaction, the sum ${\Delta}G_{R}^{\circ} - (T - 298) {\Delta}S_{R}^{\circ} + (p - 1){\Delta}V_{R}^{\circ}$ is greater than zero if the reactants are stable, or less than zero if the products are stable. (2) Linear relationships between the standard state free energies and entropies of different reactions are expressed as linear equations. (3) The resulting system of inequalities and equations is solved by the techniques of linear programming, maximizing and minimizing the standard state free energy and entropy of each reaction in turn. (4) If the experimental data are internally consistent, the limits of each of the thermochemical constants for each reaction are obtained. If the experiments are inconsistent, the offending experiments may be identified. Application of the technique to the results of experimental investigations of 18 reactions in the system CaO-Al₂O₃-SiO₂-H₂O-CO₂ indicates that the data tested are all consistent. The procedure may be extended to determine thermodynamic properties of individual phases.},

The model is calibrated using (l) the partitioning relations of Mg and Fe between spinels and olivine, (2) the distribution coefficients for the exchange of Al and Cr between spinels and (Al,Cr)2O3 solid solutions, (3) the features of the miscibility gaps in chromium titanium aluminum spinels, (4) the activity composition data in the chromite-magnetite subsystem, and (5) the constraints of cation site ordering. It is consistent with the observations summarized by Sack and Ghiorso (1991) for Cr-free spinels. The calibration is achieved with the further simplifying assumption that all thermodynamic parameters corresponding to second-degree Taylor coefrcients are constants independent of temperature (i.e., there are no excess vibrational entropies of mixing).The proposed model is internally consistent with the thermodynamic data of Berman (1988) and our previous analyses of the solution properties of olivine, orthopyroxene, and rhombohedral oxides (Sack and Ghiorso, 1989; Ghiorso, 1990a). We develop a geo- thermometer based on the exchange of Mg and Fe between olivine and spinel that may be applied with confidence to assemblages that formed at low pressures and at temperatures between 400 and 1400 $\,^{\circ}$C. We utilize this geothermometer to define equilibration temperatures for subassemblages of olivine + spinel in metamorphosed ultramafic rocks of the greenschist-amphibolite facies. Phase relations within the spinel prism [(Fe,Mg)(Al,Cr,Fe3+)2O4] are calculated for temperatures over the range 500--600 $\,^{\circ}$C and compare favorably with petrologic observations.}},

The method of mathematical programming was used to achieve consistency of derived properties with phase equilibrium, calorimetric, and volumetric data, utilizing equations that account for the thermodynamic consequences of first and second order phase transitions, and temperature-dependent disorder. Tabulated properties are in good agreement with thermophysical data, as well as being consistent with the bulk of phase equilibrium data obtained in solubility studies, weight change experiments, and reversals involving both single and mixed volatile species. The reliability of the thermodynamic data set is documented by extensive comparisons (Figs. 4--45) between computed equilibria and phase equilibrium data. The high degree of consistency obtained with these diverse experimental data gives confidence that the refined thermodynamic properties should allow accurate prediction of phase relationships among stoichiometric minerals in complex chemical systems, and provide a reasonable basis from which activity models for minerals may be derived.}},

@article{Sack:1989aa,
	abstract = {A thermodynamic solution model is developed for minerals whose compositions lie in the two binary systems Mg2SiO4-Fe2SiO4 and Mg2Si2O6-Fe2Si2O6. The formulation makes explicit provision for nonconvergent ordering of Fe2+ and Mg2+ between M1 and M2 sites in orthopyroxenes and non-zero Gibbs energies of reciprocal ordering reactions in both olivine and orthopyroxene. The calibration is consistent with (1) constraints provided by available experimental and natural data on the Fe-Mg exchange reaction between olivine and orthopyroxene $\pm$quartz, (2) site occupancy data on orthopyroxenes including both crystallographic refinements and M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy, (3) enthalpy of solution data on olivines and orthopyroxenes and enthalpy of disordering data on orthopyroxene, (4) available data on the temperature and ordering dependence of the excess volume of orthopyroxene solid solutions, and (5) direct activity-composition determinations of orthopyroxene and olivine solid solutions at elevated temperatures. Our analysis suggests that the entropies of the exchange {$[$}Mg(M2)Fe(M1)⇔Fe(M2)Mg(M1){$]$} and reciprocal ordering reactions {$[$}Mg(M2)Mg(M1)+ Fe(M2)Fe(M1)⇔Fe(M2)Mg(M1)+Mg(M2)Fe(M1){$]$} cannot differ significantly ($\pm$1 cal/K) from zero over the temperature range of calibration (400$\,^{\circ}$--1300$\,^{\circ}$C). Consideration of the mixing properties of olivine-orthopyroxene solid solutions places tight constraints on the standard state thermodynamic quantities describing Fe-Mg exchange reactions involving olivine, orthopyroxene, pyralspite garnets, aluminate spinels, ferrite spinels and biotite. These constraints are entirely consistent with the standard state properties for the phasesα-quartz,β-quartz, orthoenstatite, clinoenstatite, protoenstatite, fayalite, ferrosilite and forsterite which were deduced by Berman (1988) from an independent analysis of phase equilibria and calorimetric data. In conjunction with these standard state properties, the solution model presented in this paper provides a means of evaluating an internally consistent set of Gibbs energies of mineral solid solutions in the system Mg2SiO4-Fe2SiO4-SiO2 over the temperature range 0--1300$\,^{\circ}$C and pressure interval 0.001--50 kbars. As a consequence of our analysis, we find that the excess Gibbs energies associated with mixing of Fe and Mg in (Fe, Mg)2SiO4 olivines, (Fe, Mg)3Al2Si3O12 garnets, (Fe, Mg)Al2O4 and (Fe, Mg)Fe2O4 spinels, and K(Mg, Fe)3AlSi3O10(OH)2 biotites may be satisfactory described, on a macroscopic basis, with symmetric regular solution type parameters having values of 4.86$\pm$0.12 (olivine), 3.85$\pm$0.09 (garnet), 1.96$\pm$0.13 (spinel), and 3.21$\pm$0.29 kcals/gfw (biotite). Applications of the proposed solution model demonstrate the sensitivity of petrologic modeling to activity-composition relations of olivine-orthopyroxene solutions. We explore the consequences of estimating the activity of silica in melts forming in the mantle and we develop a graphical geothermometer/geobarometer for metamorphic assemblages of olivine+orthopyroxene+quartz. Quantitative evaluation of these results suggests that accurate and realistic estimates of silica activity in melts derived from mantle source regions,P-T paths of metamorphism and other intensive variables of petrologic interest await further refinements involving the addition of ``trace''elements (Al3+ and Fe3+) to the thermodynamic formulation for orthopyroxenes.},

@article{Sack:1991aa,
	abstract = {A model is developed for the thermodynamic properties of Fe2+−Mg2+-aluminate-titanate-ferrite spinels of space group Fd3m. The model incorporates an expression for the configurational entropy of mixing which accounts for long-range order over tetrahedral and octahedral sites. Short-range order or departures from cubic symmetry are not considered. The non-configurational Gibbs energy is formulated as a second degree Taylor expansion in six linearly independent composition and ordering variables. The model parameters are calibrated to reproduce miscibility gap constraints, order-disorder phenomena in MgAl2O4 and MgFe2O4, and Fe2+−Mg2+ partitioning data between olivine and: (1) aluminate spinels; (2) ferrite spinels; (3) titanate spinels; (4) mixed aluminate-ferrite spinels. This calibration is achieved without invoking non-configurational excess entropies of mixing. The model predicts that the ordering state of FeAl2O4 is more normal than that of MgAl2O4. It also successfully accounts for heat of solution measurements and activity-composition relations in the constituent binaries. Phase equilibrium constraints require that the structure of Fe3O4 is more inverse than random at all temperatures and that Mg2+ has a strong tetrahedral site preference with respect to that of Fe2+. The analysis suggests that in the titanates short range order on octahedral sites may be significant at temperatures as high as 1300$\,^{\circ}$C. Constraints developed from calibrating the thermodynamic properties of Fe2+−Mg2+-aluminatetitanate-ferrite spinel solid solutions permit extension of the database of Berman (1988) to include estimates of the end-member properties of hercynite (FeAl2O4), ulv{\"o}spinel (Fe2TiO4), MgFe2O4 and cubic Mg2TiO4. In constructing these estimates, provision is made for low-temperature magnetic entropy contributions and the energetic consequences of disordering the aluminates and the ferrites. These estimates are consistent with all of the available low-temperature adiabatic calorimetry, high-temperature heat content, and heat of solution measurements on the end-members. The analysis implies that there is a substantial heat capacity anomaly in the range 300$\,^{\circ}$--900$\,^{\circ}$C associated with disordering of the MgAl2O4 structure while that in FeAl2O4 becomes significant at temperatures above 700$\,^{\circ}$C. The same heat capacity response in the ferrites indicates that the order/disorder transformation is coupled to the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition in MgFe2O4 but takes place well above the ferrimagnetic-paramagnetic transition in magnetite. The proposed model is internally consistent with solution theory reported elsewhere for Fe2+−Mg2+ olivines and orthopyroxenes (Sack and Ghiorso 1989), rhombohedral oxides (Ghiorso 1990a) and the remaining end-member properties of Berman (1988).},

	abstract = {A new thermodynamic formulation of the Fe−Ti oxide geothermometer/oxygen barometer is developed. The method is based upon recently calibrated models for spinel solid solutions in the quinary system (Fe2+, Mg)(Al,Fe3+,Cr)2O4−(Fe2+, Mg)2TiO4 by Sack and Ghiorso, and rhombohedral oxides in the quaternary system (Fe2+,Mg,Mn)TiO3−Fe2O3 (this paper). The formulation is internally consistent with thermodynamic models for (Fe2+,Mg)-olivine and -orthopyroxene solid solutions and end-member thermodynamic properties tabulated by Berman. The constituent expressions account for compositional and temperature dependent cation ordering and reproduce miscibility gap features in all of the component binaries. The calibration does not account for the excess Gibbs energy resulting from compositional and temperature dependent magnetic ordering in either phase. This limits application of the method to assemblages that equilibrated at temperatures above 600$\,^{\circ}$C. Practical implementation of the proposed geothermometer/oxygen barometer requires minimal use of projection algorthms in accommodating compositions of naturally occurring phases. The new formulation is applied to the estimation of temperature and oxygen fugacity in a wide variety of intermediate to silicic volcanic rocks. In combination with previous work on olivine and orthopyroxene thermodynamics, equilibration pressures are computed for a subset of these volcanics that contain the assemblage quartz, oxides and either ferromagnesian silicate. The calculated log10fO2-T relations are reflected in coexisting ferromagnesian mineral assemblages. Volcanics with the lowest relative oxygen fugacity (Δlog10fO2) are characterized by the assemblage olivine-quartz, those with slightly higher Δlog10fO2 s, by the assemblage orthopyroxene-quartz. The sequence proceeds with the necessary phases biotite-feldspar, then hornblende-quartz-clinopyroxene, and finally at the highest Δlog10fO2 s, sphene-quartz-clinopyroxene. Quantitative analysis of these trends, utilizing thermodynamic data for the constituent phases, establishes that, in most cases, the T-log10fO2value computed from the oxides is consistent with the compositions of coexisting silicate phases, indicating that phenocryst equilibrium was achieved prior to eruption. There is, however, considerable evidence of oxide-silicate disequilibrium in samples collected from more slowly cooled domes and obsidians. In addition, T-log10fO2trends from volcanic rocks that contain biotite and orthopyroxene are interpreted to imply a condition of Fe2+−Mg exchange disequilibrium between orthopyroxene and coexisting ferromagnesian silicates and melt. It is suspected that many biotite-feldspar-quartz-orthopyroxene bearing low temperature volcanic rocks inherit orthopyroxene xenocrysts which crystallized earlier in the cooling history of the magma body.},

	abstract = {A solution model is developed for rhombohedral oxide solid solutions having compositions within the ternary system ilmenite {$[$}(Fe2+sTi4+1−s)A(Fe2+1−sTi4+s)BO3{$]$}-geikielite {$[$}(Mg2+tTi4+1−t)A(Mg2+1−tTi4+t)BO3{$]$}-hematite {$[$}(Fe3+)A(Fe3+)BO3{$]$}. The model incorporates an expression for the configurational entropy of solution, which accounts for varying degrees of structural long-range order (0≤s, t≤1) and utilizes simple regular solution theory to characterize the excess Gibbs free energy of mixing within the five-dimensional composition-ordering space. The 13 model parameters are calibrated from available data on: (1) the degree of long-range order and the composition-temperature dependence of the{\$}{\$}R{$\backslash$}bar 3c - R{$\backslash$}bar 3{\$}{\$}transition along the ilmenite-hematite binary join; (2) the compositions of coexisting olivine and rhombohedral oxide solid solutions close to the Mg−Fe2+ join; (3) the shape of the miscibility gap along the ilmenite-hematite join; (4) the compositions of coexisting spinel and rhombohedral oxide solid solutions along the Fe2+−Fe3+ join. In the course of calibration, estimates are obtained for the reference state enthalpy of formation of ulv{\"o}spinel and stoichiometric hematite (−1488.5 and −822.0 kJ/mol at 298 K and 1 bar, respectively). The model involves no excess entropies of mixing nor does it incorporate ternary interaction parameters. The formulation fits the available data and represents an internally consistent energetic model when used in conjuction with the standard state thermodynamic data set of Berman (1988) and the solution theory for orthopyroxenes, olivines and Fe−Mg titanomagnetite-aluminate-chromate spinels developed by Sack and Ghiorso (1989, 1990a, b). Calculated activity-composition relations for the end-members of the series, demonstrate the substantial degree of nonideality associated with interactions between the ordered and disordered structures and the dominant influence of the miscibility gap across much of the ternary system. The predicted shape of the miscibility gap, and the orientation of tie-lines relating the compositions of coexisting phases, display the effects of coupling between the excess enthalpy of solution and the degree of long-range order. One limb of the miscibility gap follows the composititiontemperature surface corresponding to the ternary{\$}{\$}R{$\backslash$}bar 3 - R{$\backslash$}bar 3c{\$}{\$}second-order transition.},

In this method, a regular solution approximation was adopted for the hematite-ilmenite solid solution (α phase) and the magnetite-ulv{\"o}spinel solid solution (β phase). Geothermometer and oxygen barometer have been shown in two ways. One method is to read from the graph, and the other is numerical formulation. Within the Buddington and Lindsley experimental conditions, the uncertainty of the geothermometer and oxygen barometer is $\pm$ 11$\,^{\circ}$C for temperature and $\pm$ 0.32 at log fO2. The maximum difference between equilibrium temperature and oxygen fugacity estimated by the graphical method of Buddington and Lindsley and the thermodynamic methods using the chemical composition of naturally coexisting ilmenite and magnetite is so far 180$\,^{\circ}$C for temperature and 5 at log fO2.},

	abstract = {The titanomagnetite of the Lac Dor\'e Complex, an Archean layered intrusion that is located in the Abitibi greenstone belt in Qu\'ebec (Canada), contains a wide variety of exsolution textures, which are the remnants of a complex cooling history. In the present study, we reconstitute the decomposition stages of the original solid solution in order to explain the formation of ilmenite, Al-spinel (hercynite and gahnite), and corundum exsolutions in magnetite. This was conducted through a detailed mineralogical and textural examination and in situ determination of mineral chemistry. Our investigation reveals two discrete types of ilmenite exsolutions, which are ascribed, respectively, to the oxidation of ulv\"ospinel at temperatures above and below the magnetite-ulv\"ospinel solvus. Exsolutions of Al-spinel result from either a decrease in the solubility of the (FeZn)Al2O4 components upon cooling, or local excesses of Al and Zn due to the removal of ulv\"ospinel during the early oxidation. The origin of corundum is ascribed to the oxidation of pre-existing hercynite exsolutions. The trace element composition of the titanomagnetite indicates stratigraphic reversals in Cr, Mg, Co, Ti, and Si and important changes in redox conditions. We interpret this as a direct consequence of a major event of magma chamber replenishment, which strongly influenced the distribution of exsolutions.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the effects of liquid-liquid phase separation on the igneous evolution of planetary bodies, we investigated immiscibility in the systems CaO-SiO2, MgO-SiO2, and CaMgSi2O6-SiO2 at pressures to 1.5 GPa. Few changes are observed in the size of the miscibility gaps in these systems at 1.0 GPa. The decrease of the stable area of the gaps is mainly due to the increase of the monotectic temperature because the latter closely follows the melting temperature of SiO2 at high pressure. The pressure at which the whole CaO-MgO-SiO2 miscibility gap becomes metastable is estimated to be 1.81 GPa. The thermal and compositional extents of miscibility gaps associated with network-modifier cations (such as Ca2+) do not change significantly with increasing pressure, but the extents are increased for amphoteric cations (such as Mg2+), and the change is more pronounced if the latter have small ionic radii and high ionic potentials. Cations possessing high crystal field stabilization energies produce the largest immiscibility fields at atmospheric pressure, and the passage from the high-spin to the low-spin state with increasing pressure is expected to yield even larger miscibility gaps. Magmas containing substantial amounts of amphoteric cations and cations with high crystal field stabilization energies are therefore potential candidates to develop immiscibility at high pressures.},

	abstract = {The local structural response of Ca/Mg substitution and the energetic effects associated with dodecahedral ordering in the pyrope-grossular garnet solid solution are derived from a combination of static lattice energy calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We start with a thorough analysis of the goodness of the empirical potential models used for the modelling of aluminosilicate garnets. The degree of polyhedral distortion was found to be a sensitive indicator for the quality of the model and, by comparison with experimental data, was used to select the best of several available empirical potentials. The Ca/Mg substitution on the dodecahedral site in garnet was found to produce strong local distortions in the surrounding tetrahedral and octahedral polyhedra. This arises from the absence of rigid unit modes (RUMS) in the garnet structure, because local rotations of otherwise rigid SiO4 tetrahedra and AlO6 octahedra cannot occur in order to accommodate different-sized divalent cations in the dodecahedral sites. Strain effects, therefore, mainly govern the dodecahedral substitution, and the corresponding strain field around a dodecahedral site has a minimum radius of 5 {\AA}. Pyrope-grossular solid solution compositions were modelled using a supercell approach. For several garnet compositions many different configurations representing individual disordered arrangements were relaxed. The resulting energies were analyzed in terms of different-neighbour interactions to determine the parameters of a model Hamiltonian. The corresponding interaction energies were found to be virtually independent of composition. Surprisingly, the nearest-neighbour interaction between edge-sharing dodecahedra is of no particular significance in the garnets. Instead, the strongest interaction is only via the third-nearest neighbours, i.e. dodecahedra that are edge-shared to a common SiO4 tetrahedron. This cannot lead to dodecahedral long-range order in garnets, but can produce significant amounts of short-range order. Monte Carlo simulations were performed on several compositions to determine the macroscopic effects such as NMR-based cluster occupancy, ordering energy and configurational entropy of the short-range ordering process. As expected, the samples tend to random disorder at high temperatures, and at low temperatures it is compositions nearer Py50Gr50 that depart most strongly from random mixing. For example, a maximum reduction of 3.5 J mol−1 K−1 is predicted for Py75Gr25 and ∼10 J mol−1 K−1 for Py50Gr50. A comparison of NMR cluster occupancy with experimental 29Si MAS NMR resonance intensity is partly successful. However, the changes in NMR cluster occupancy are relatively low (∼5{\%}) compared to changes in configurational entropy (∼30{\%}), implying that it might be difficult to estimate exact entropy data from 29Si MAS NMR line intensities.},

	abstract = {Plagioclase feldspars are key components of terrestrial planets and deriving their phase diagram and activity--composition relations has been the subject of many studies. Three main approaches have been used for thermodynamic modelling of the behaviour of plagioclase feldspars, and all three disagree in terms of the magnitude and relative importance of mixing energies and ordering energies. The present study uses Monte Carlo simulations based on classical atomistic modelling to provide independent constraints over ordering and mixing for anorthite and its solid solution with albite. Unsurprisingly, Al-avoidance plays a key role. The competition between first-neighbour and second-neighbour interactions is highlighted, providing simple explanations to the high degree of short-range order in macroscopically disordered plagioclase. The mixing properties obtained in this study support strong non-ideality, with negative mixing enthalpy and temperature-dependent mixing entropy. Ordering energies are consistent with studies using Landau theory. Unfortunately, the form of the Landau equations hindered parametrisation of a full thermodynamic model from albite to anorthite, even though the thermodynamic formalism remains simple. Reasons, perspectives, and implications for the phase diagram of ternary feldspars are discussed.},

	abstract = {{Thermodynamics of order-disorder in minerals may be approached by treating the mineral as a solid solution between an independent set of end-members with which the range of possible states of ordering of the phase can be represented. Thus, a mineral of fixed composition (a one-component phase), requiring s independent order parameters to represent the state of order in the mineral, involves an independent set of s + 1 end-members. This approach is applied by means of symmetric formalism, with the entropy part of the Gibbs energy taken to be the ideal configurational entropy of mixing using a mixing-on-sites formulation, and the enthalpy part taken to be that of a regular solution between the s + 1 end-members. Symmetric formalism is shown to be formally identical to the generalized Bragg-Williams or point approximation, and its treatment of convergent and non-convergent cation ordering is compared with that of the Landau theory. Its flexibility in describing a wide range of order-disorder behavior is illustrated with applications to sillimanite, spinel, albite, and potassium feldspar, the latter two involving order-parameter coupling.}},

	abstract = {Summary The basic aspects of redox geochemistry are reviewed to provide a useful compendium of the redox connection between the aqueous-hydrothermal and igneous realms of Earth. The redox description of a system is intimately coupled to the knowledge of acid-base properties of the solvent in which redox exchanges take place. For magmas, and then silicate melts, approaches reporting the redox state were so far cantered around the sole concept of oxygen fugacity, f O 2 . Mastering the concept of f O 2 in experimental and observational petrology was the key to constrain the processes behind the very large range of relative oxygen fugacity observed on Earth. Although current descriptions of silicate melts and magma thermodynamic properties are mainly based on oxides or mineral-like molecular components, disregarding the actual melt reactivity poses many limits in our understanding of the true chemical exchanges involving oxygen, iron and the other redox-sensitive elements. Because silicate melts, unlike aqueous solutions, lack of a full acid-base description, compositional dependencies are solved by means of empirical treatments based on oxides and their combinations. However, these can bias the interpretation of redox exchanges recorded in analyzed samples and used to identify the several processes (e.g., batch or fractional crystallization, elemental recycling, degassing, deep fluid infiltration) which characterize magma evolution and its geodynamic environment. This short compendium aims at stimulating the quest for a comprehensive and unifying picture of the acid-base and redox properties of melts from which we could extrinsic its reactivity in way similar to aqueous solutions and molten salts.},

	abstract = {{Equilibrium crystallization experiments at atmospheric pressure and over a range of oxygen fugacity (fO2) have been carried out on a ferro-basaltic composition similar to liquids proposed to have been parental to much of the exposed portion of the Skaergaard intrusion. Before Fe-Ti oxide saturation the liquid line of descent is little affected by fO2. However, the appearance temperatures of the magnetite-ulv{\"o}spinel solid solution (Mt) and the ilmenite-haematite solid solution (Ilm) depend strongly on fO2. Above the fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) buffer Mt is the first oxide phase to appear on the liquidus, but below the FMQ buffer Ilm is the first oxide to crystallize. The appearance temperature of Mt is ∼1100$\,^{\circ}$C at FMQ and the Mt liquidus slope is ∼30$\,^{\circ}$C/log fO2 unit between FMQ−;2 and FMQJ+1. The Ilm liquidus is at ∼1100$\,^{\circ}$C between FMQ and FMQ−2, but moves to lower temperature at higher fO2 where Mt is the first oxide phase. The results indicate that the ferric iron content of Mt-saturated melts varies linearly with inverse temperature, and that Ilm saturation is closely related to melt TiO2 content. Mt saturation produces an immediate enrichment of SiO2 and depletion in FeO* in the melt phase, whereas Ilm saturation produces similar enrichment in SiO2, but inn enrichment may continue for ∼10$\,^{\circ}$C below the ilmenite liquidus. The experimental liquids reach a maximum of ∼18 wt\\% FeO*, at ∼48 wt\\% SiO2 for ilmenite-saturated melts at low fO2, more differentiated melts having lower iron and higher silica. Cotectic proportions, derived from mass balance calculations, are in good agreement with data from natural samples and other experimental studies. Olivine resorption is inferred at all fO2, with the onset of resorption occurring ∼10$\,^{\circ}$C higher than the appearance of magnetite. The effect of fO2 on silicate mineral compositions, and partitioning of elements between coexisting mineral-melt pairs, is small. Thermodynamic considerations suggest that variations of Fe-Mg partitioning between the iron-rich olivines, pyroxenes and melts produced in this study may be explained by known non-idealities of Fe-Mg mixing in the crystalline phases, rather than nonidealities in the coexisting melts. These experiments also provide insights into many features common to natural tholeiitic series of volcanic and plutonic rocks, and provide experimental data required for modelling of fractional crystallization and crystallization closed to oxygen, processes which are not easily investigated experimentally.}},

@article{Rodehorst:2004aa,
	abstract = {Local structural heterogeneities in crystals of the binary grossular--spessartine solid solution have been analyzed using powder IR absorption spectroscopy. Wavenumber shifts of the highest energy Si--O stretching mode in spectra collected at room temperature are consistent with variations in Si--O bond length from structural data. They show a smaller positive deviation from linearity across the join than is seen for the grossular--pyrope and grossular--almandine binaries. The effective line widths, Δcorr, of three selected wavenumber regions all deviate positively from linear behaviour. An empirical calibration of this excess spectroscopic property, obtained by comparison with calorimetric enthalpy of mixing data, gives an estimate for the symmetric Margules parameter of WHspec = 14.4(7) kJ mol−1 in ΔHmix = WHspecXGrXSp. WHspec values derived on the same basis for four aluminosilicate garnet solid solutions analyzed by IR spectroscopy vary with ΔV2, where ΔV represents the difference in molar volume between the end members of each binary system. Measurements of lattice parameters and IR spectra were made over a range of temperatures for seven samples with different compositions. Positive excess molar volumes of mixing at low temperature (30 K) may be larger than the excess molar volumes at room temperature. The saturation temperatures of the molar volumes show no correlation with composition, however, in contrast with what had been expected on the basis of data for the grossular--pyrope binary. Saturation temperatures for spectroscopic parameters and lattice parameters of samples with compositions Gr15Sp85 and Gr60Sp40 seem to be outliers in all experiments. It is concluded that the data hint at systematic changes in saturation temperatures across the solid solution, with implications for both the excess entropy of mixing and the excess volume of mixing, but more precise data or further sample characterization are needed to prove that this composition dependence is real in garnet solid solutions.},

	abstract = {The experimental works of Russian and foreign researchers focused on the behavior of ore minerals, such as titanomagnetite and ilmenite in an oxidizing environment in different temperature ranges, have been analyzed. The optimum temperature conditions and time interval for oxidizing roasting of mineral aggregates have been substantiated. The Medvedevskoe ores are described in brief. Special attention is paid to the mineral assemblages of disseminated titanomagnetite--ilmenite ore subjected to secondary alterations, such as amphibolization, chloritization, saussuritization, albitization, and martitization. The evolution of the phase and structural heterogeneity of titanomagnetite microaggregates is observed as variations in the composition and structure of magnetite--ilmenite exsolution products under collective recrystallization complicated by martitization processes. Oxidizing roasting (T = 1000--1100$\,^{\circ}$C) of titanomagnetite aggregates makes it possible to reduce the degree of their heterogeneity and form stable mineral phases, such as pseudobrookite, hematite, and rutile with subsequent enlargement thereof. The heterogeneous structure of titanomagnetite microaggregates affects the course of heterogeneous oxidation processes in microaggregates of different mineral assemblages. Due to solid-phase transformations, martitized titanomagnetite (with ilmenite lamellae) changes completely with the formation of pseudobrookite--hematite microaggregates. Ilmenite at the contact with hematite, as well as in individual grains, is transformed into complex fine-grained rutile--pseudobrookite aggregates. The newly formed minerals are mostly solid solutions. Pseudobrookite is characterized by a reduced Fe2O3 content (up to 62.71 wt {\%}) with 33.51 wt {\%} TiO2. Hematite as an transformation product of martitized magnetite contains up to 4.90 wt {\%} TiO2. Rutile forms limited solid solutions with pseudobrookite, and Fe2O3 reaches 7.59 wt {\%}. With a decrease in material size, the solid-phase transformation process becomes more active; therefore, the optimum size grades include --0.25 + 0.125 mm and --0.125 + 0.071 mm. The solid-phase transformation of primary ore minerals is almost completed during the roasting for 72 h. The homogenization of mineral aggregates and the enlargement of newly formed Fe- and Ti-bearing minerals makes them better detectable in technological products and improves the general Ti extraction in various products. The results obtained in the course of high-temperature oxidizing roasting of magnetite--ilmenite ores at the Medvedevskoe deposit can be of interest to geologists studying the formation processes of magmatic magnetite--ilmenite deposits, which vary widely in terms of both mineralization composition (from low-grade Ti ores to extremely hard-to-process high-grade Ti ores) and formation conditions (deposits of various depth facies) and depend considerably on the oxygen regime and composition of volatile mineralizing elements (H2O, Cl, F, etc.).},

	abstract = {Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of stream sediments collected from 30 stations in the Dahab-Wadi Kid area (southeastern Sinai, Egypt) are presented. The studied sediments contain considerable amounts of heavy minerals, including abundant Fe--Ti oxides, with up to 25.94{\%} index figure that measures the relative abundance of heavy minerals to light minerals. Immaturity of the sediments and nature of Fe--Ti oxide intergrowths, in addition to some non-opaque heavy minerals, indicate multiple provenances with contributions from a variety of Neoproterozoic mafic to felsic intrusions. Appreciable amounts of heavy minerals are derived from schists that belong to the so-called Wadi Kid volcano-sedimentary group. Owing to the considerable contribution of the felsic intrusions represented by within-plate granites, the sediments are enriched in REE-bearing minerals (e.g., monazite, cerianite, La-cerianite and allanite), V-bearing thorite, zircon, and a ZrO2 phase. The majority of Fe--Ti oxides are derived from the mafic intrusions, and they show evidence of pre-, syn- and post-depositional phases of alteration and formation of intergrowths. As to the geochemical signature of the bulk silt fraction, there is remarkable enrichment of LREEs with distinct negative Eu anomaly, and this supports dominance of a provenance dominated by felsic intrusions (i.e., the A-type within-plate granite and associated pegmatites). Also, the felsic provenance is responsible for slight abnormality of ∑U + Th content (up to \~{} 37 ppm) and few anomalous samples bear uraniferous zircon and Ce-type monazite. The present paper sheds light on the fertility of the Dahab stream sediments in some economic minerals for possible future exploitation, not for gold only, but for potential REE-bearing minerals that are needed for a wide spectrum of modern technological industries.},

	abstract = {The Iratsu body is the largest eclogitic body in the Sanbagawa belt, central Shikoku, composed of schists with pumpellyite--actinolite, through blueschist/greenschist transition and epidote-amphibolite, up to eclogite-facies grades. The Iratsu body and the underlying Higashi-Akaishi peridotite body are situated in the intermediate structural level of the Sanbagawa belt which occurs as a subhorizontal thin slab. In the Iratsu body, eclogites and eclogitic metagabbros (garnet-clinopyroxenites) contain garnet+omphacite+epidote+quartz+rutile$\pm$phengite$\pm$glaucophane$\pm$paragonite$\pm$barroisite$\pm$kyanite, and garnet+sodic augite+rutile$\pm$epidote$\pm$zoisite$\pm$quartz, respectively, as mineral assemblages at the peak P--T conditions. Textural relations between these minerals and secondary minerals indicate that the eclogites were retrograded by hydration under eclogite through epidote-amphibolite to greenschist-facies conditions. Geothermobarometry for the peak metamorphism of the eclogites yielded conditions of 1.4--2.5 GPa and 500--800 $\,^{\circ}$C in the Iratsu body; the estimated P--T conditions gradually change across the body. Eclogites with higher P--T estimates are predominant in the southern part of the body, and the eclogites near a contact with the Higashi-Akaishi body show the highest P--T conditions. Integration of these results with previously published P--T estimates for various rock types suggests a sandwiched thermobaric structure. The highest P--T area is situated in an intermediate structural level, i.e., in the upper part of the Higashi-Akaishi body near the boundary with the Iratsu body, and the metamorphic conditions systematically decrease towards the upper and lower levels not only within the Iratsu body but also in the surrounding lower grade schists. Our thermobaric structure implies that the Iratsu and Higashi-Akaishi composite mass is not a tectonic block but is the integral part of the Sanbagawa belt, which has been formed together with the surrounding schists under a specific thermal gradient at depths in the subduction zone. The Sanbagawa metamorphic facies series, newly proposed, draws a convex curve towards the lower P and higher T side in a P--T diagram, and is similar to a steady-state P--T path in a subduction zone, calculated by numerical models.},

	abstract = {Variations of redox conditions (i.e., oxygen fugacity, fO2) accompanying slab dehydration in subduction zones are subject to ongoing controversies, especially since the interplay between redox sensitive elements during prograde metamorphism remains complex and, likely, variable at the slab scale. Here we investigate fO2 variations during serpentinite dehydration and their feedback on the stability of sulfur and carbon compounds by studying the eclogitic Monviso meta-ophiolite (Western Alps, Italy). Despite a complex metamorphic history, the Monviso massif has preserved a complete section of oceanic lithosphere, from seafloor metasediments, meta-ophicarbonates and metabasites to deep-seated metagabbros and metaserpentinites. By bringing new estimates in the northern massif, we show that these lithologies have recorded a homogeneous pressure and temperature (P-T) climax, at 520--570 $\,^{\circ}$C and 2.6--2.7 GPa, on the whole meta-ophiolite. Despite this homogeneous P-T record, serpentinite forming minerals imply strong variations in fO2 according to their position in the slab, from high fO2 conditions (~ FMQ +2) in the deep-seated lithologies made of heazlewoodite-magnetite-olivine assemblages to low fO2 (~ FMQ −4) in the paleoseafloor lithologies made of pentlandite-awaruite-olivine. This redox gradient is opposed to what is expected at mid-ocean ridges and is therefore likely set up during serpentinite dehydration. Such variations of fO2 conditions also influenced carbon distribution and redox state within the lithosphere. In particular, reducing conditions associated with brucite breakdown in paleoseafloor serpentinites promote the formation of disordered carbonaceous matter over inorganic carbonates. Newly-formed disordered carbonaceous matter could subsequently be recycled in the deep mantle, with the potential to play a major role on the deep carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {The heat capacity of synthetic α-Fe2O3 has been measured in the range 300--1050K by adiabatic shield calorimetry with intermittent energy inputs and temperature equilibration in between. A λ-type transition, related to the change from antiferro- to paramagnetism in the compound, is delineated and a maximum heat capacity of about 195 JK−1 mole−1 is observed over a 3 K interval around 955 K. Values of thermodynamic functions have been derived and CP (1000K), [H0(1000K)-H0(0)], and [S0(1000K)-S0(0)] are 149.0JK−1 mole−1, 115.72 kJ mole−1, and 252.27 JK−1 mole−1, respectively, after inclusion of earlier low-temperature results [X0 (298.15K)-X0(0)]. The non-magnetic heat capacity is estimated and the thermodynamic properties of the magnetic transition evaluated. The results are compared with spin-wave calculations in the random phase approximation below the N{\'e}el temperature and the Oguchi pair model above. An upper estimate of the total magnetic entropy gives 32.4JK−1 mole−1, which compares favorably with that calculated for randomization of five unpaired electron spins on each iron, ΔS = 2R ln 6 = 29.79 JK−1 mole−1 for α-Fe2O3. The critical exponent α in the equation Cm = (Aα) [(|Tn−T|/Tn)−1]−α + B is −(0.50$\pm$0.10) below the maximum and 0.15$\pm$0.10 above, for Tn = 955.0K. The high temperature tail is discussed in terms of short range order.},

	abstract = {{Eclogites interlayered with gneiss and minor quartzite in the Qinglongshan near Donghai are characterized by unusually abundant (15--40 vol\\%) hydrous phases including talc, phengite, and epidote; many also contain kyanite. Garnet hosts both prograde (paragonite, amphibole, epidote) and peak stage (omphacite, epidote, phengite, kyanite) mineral inclusions. Several eclogites contain talc rimmed by barroisite; optically and compositionally similar coarse-grained amphibole in other samples indicates that the reaction Omp + Tlc = Amp has completely consumed talc. Estimated peak conditions of 30--35 kbar, 600--700 $\,^{\circ}$C, are consistent with polycrystalline quartz pseudomorphs after coesite included in garnet, omphacite, epidote, and kyanite, and up to 3.6 Si pfu (11 O atom basis) in phengite. Garnet-epidote oxygen barometry on the peak metamorphic assemblage indicates oxygen fugacities above the Hem-Mag buffer, consistent with the epidote + talc assemblage and 5--20 mol\\% aegerine component in omphacite. The high oxygen fugacity calculated in this study as well as previously documented negative oxygen isotope values recorded by these rocks may both reflect alteration by oxidizing, meteoric water in a hydrothermal system. Oxidized conditions during peak metamorphism may explain the extreme scarcity of microdiamond in this area. The Ep + Tlc assemblage is stabilized by high oxygen fugacity, and demonstrates that talc-bearing eclogites are not restricted only to unusually Mg-rich bulk compositions.}},

	abstract = {The high Fe-Ti eclogites with exsolved lamellar in 530--600 m depths from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling (CCSD) main hole in the Sulu Ultra-High Pressure (UHP) metamorphic belt, eastern China, record an anomalously high susceptibility (κ), natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and K{\"o}enigsberger ratio Q (NRM/Ji, Ji is induced magnetization). This provides us with a good opportunity to study the effects of magnetic minerals and exsolution lamellae on the magnetic properties of deep rocks. In this paper, we have measured systematically magnetic properties and mineral assemblage and structure for three special samples (No. 83, No.86 and No.89). Results show that these Fe-Ti-rich eclogites are the result of the fine-grained (titano)-magnetite exsolution in pyroxene and lamellar structure consisting of finely interlayered ilmenite and hematite in exsolved hemo-ilmenite. We found that the dominant Fe-bearing oxide minerals in samples studied are ilmenite, hematite (Hem + Ilm up to 25\%), little (titano)magnetite and pyrite. The ferromagnetic susceptibility is mainly controlled by fine grained (titano)magnetite and NRM is closely related to the exsolved lamellar structure. We hence propose that the anomalous magnetism of these eclogites observed in our samples is the result of exsolution from homogenous pyroxene and ilmeno-hematite during cooling and decompression processes. These Fe-Ti-rich eclogites might be one of the sources of high-magnetic anomalies observed in the Sulu subduction zone, eastern China.},

@article{SAMcEnroe_2005,
	abstract = {We have examined finely exsolved oxides of the hematite-ilmenite solid-solution series found in slowly cooled middle Proterozoic igneous and metamorphic rocks. These oxides impart unusually strong and stable remanent magnetization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis shows multiple generations of ilmenite and hematite exsolution lamellae, with lamellar thicknesses ranging from millimeters to 1-2 nanometers. Rock-magnetic experiments suggest that the remanence is thermally locked to the antiferromagnetism of the hematite component of the intergrowths, yet is stronger than expected for a canted antiferromagnetic hematite or coexisting paramagnetic Fe-Tiordered (R 3̄) ilmenite. In alternating field experiments a stable magnetization is observed in these samples to fields of 100 to 120 mT, indicating that the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) is stable over billions of years. This feature has implications for understanding magnetism of deep rocks on Earth, or on planets like Mars that no longer have a magnetic field. Atomic-scale simulations of an (R 3̄) ilmenite lamella in a hematite host, based on empirical cation-cation and spin-spin pair interaction parameters, show that boundary regions of the lamellae are occupied by ``contact layers'' with a hybrid composition of Fe ions, intermediate between Fe2+-rich layers in ilmenite and Fe3+-rich layers in hematite. In this paper we review current data and explore further the nature of the interface.},

	abstract = {{Recent high-resolution aeromagnetic surveys in South Norway have revealed numerous remanent anomalies over Mesoproterozoic metamorphic rocks. Studies on the nature of the minerals that are the remanent carriers has led to discoveries of titanohematite samples with unusual magnetic properties caused by nanoscale exsolution lamellae with their related lamellar magnetism. Here we focus on a rock unit dominated by quartz-plagioclase-biotite granulite containing titanohematite grains with a strong lattice-preferred orientation parallel to regional foliation. When samples with their natural remanent magnetization (NRM), acquired nearly 1 billion years ago, are cooled to 10 K and hysteresis loops measured, these loops show bi-modal exchange bias caused by the magnetism induced within the ilmenite by antiferromagnetic coupling with the adjacent lamellar NRM. By contrast when the samples are cooled in a strong magnetic field (1.5 Tesla), this results in unimodal lamellar magnetism, and, below the TN of ilmenite it adopts a consistent negative orientation, giving rise to unimodal negative exchange bias of \\&gt;500 mT. The results presented here cover the chemical and magnetic properties, Mossbauer results and transmission electron microscopy of the titanohematite and ilmenite lamellae. Initial magnetic experiments indicated the shifts found in the exchange-bias experiments were directly related to the orientation of the sample to the applied field and the initial state of the NRM. In most samples with these unusual magnetic properties, ilmenite lamellae could not be seen in an optical or a scanning electron microscope. However magnetic experiments gave proof of the presence of ilmenite, later confirmed by M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy. Several attempts were made to identify ilmenite in TEM studies, finally successful in showing ilmenite lamellae parallel to (001) of hematite with thicknesses ∼1.2 to 1.7 nm and aspect ratios 7--13. Here we compare new TEM images and the magnetic behaviour of these samples to the MOD2 samples that previously showed extraordinary exchange bias properties, and investigate further the nature of these magnetic minerals.}},

	abstract = {{This is the second of three papers investigating properties of titanohematite-bearing quartzo-feldspathic rocks that create a significant remanent magnetic anomaly in the Modum District, South Norway. The first paper provided initial magnetic results, mineralogical characterization and evidence for the presence of lamellar magnetism. In this paper, knowledge of lamellar magnetic properties is explored through experiments where ilmenite lamellae were magnetized below 57 K, and interact magnetically along interfaces with the titanohematite host. Samples with known NRM directions were placed in specific orientations in an MPMS then cooled in zero field to 5 K, where hysteresis loops were measured in fields up to 5 Tesla. This assured that results were ultimately related to the natural lamellar magnetism produced during cooling ∼1 billion years ago. In a second set of experiments the same oriented samples, were subjected to a +5 Tesla (T) field then field cooled to 5 K before hysteresis experiments. The first experiments consistently produced asymmetric shifted hysteresis loops with two loop separations, one in a positive field and one in a negative field. Without exception, when the NRM was oriented toward the negative field end of the MPMS, the bimodal loop showed a dominant loop separation in a positive field. By contrast, when the NRM was oriented toward the positive field end of the MPMS, the bimodal loop showed a dominant loop separation in a negative field. Both observations are consistent with antiferromagnetic coupling between the hard magnetization of ilmenite and the more easily shifted lamellar magnetism of the hematite. The bimodal nature of the loops indicates that the NRMs are vector sums of natural lamellar moments, which are oriented both positively and negatively, and that these opposite moments control the orientations of ilmenite magnetizations when cooling through 57 K. Here, extreme exchange biases up to 1.68 T were measured. The second set of experiments produced asymmetric shifted hysteresis loops with one opening always in the negative field. These observations indicate that the +5 T field applied at room temperature rotated the hematite lamellar magnetism in a positive direction, so that upon cooling all the ilmenite lamellae acquired negative magnetic moments, thus causing unimodal negatively shifted loops. Here, the largest exchange bias among the unimodal loops was only 0.7 T. These results will be used in paper III to build a better understanding of lamellar magnetism at the atomic layer scale.}},

	abstract = {{Lamellar magnetism is a source of remanent magnetization in natural rocks different from common bulk magnetic moments in ferrimagnetic minerals. It has been found to be a source for a wide class of magnetic anomalies with extremely high Koenigsberger ratio. Its physical origin are uncompensated interface moments in contact layers of nanoscale ilmenite lamellae inside an hematite host, which also generate unusual low-temperature (low-T) magnetic properties, such as shifted low-T hysteresis loops due to exchange bias.The atomic-magnetic basis for the exchange bias discovered in the hematite-ilmenite system is explored in a series of papers. In this third article of the series, simple models are developed for lamellae interactions of different structures when samples are either cooled in zero-field, or field-cooled in 5 T to temperatures below the ordering temperature of ilmenite. These models are built on the low-temperature measurements described earlier in Paper II. The important observations include: (i) the effects of lamellar shapes on magnetic coupling, (ii) the high-T acquisition of lamellar magnetism and low-T acquisition of magnetization of ilmenite lamellae, (iii) the intensity of lamellar magnetism and the consequent ilmenite magnetism in populations of randomly oriented crystals, (iv) lattice-preferred orientation of the titanohematite host crystal populations and (v) the effects of magnetic domain walls in the host on hysteresis properties. Based on exemplary growth models of lamellae with different geometries and surface couplings we here provide simple models to assess and explain the different observations listed above. Already the simplified models show that the shapes of the edges of ilmenite lamellae against their hematite hosts can control the degree of low-T coupling between ilmenite, and the lamellar magnetic moments. The models also explain certain features of the low-T exchange bias in the natural samples and emphasize the role of lattice-preferred orientation upon the intensity of remanent magnetization. The inverse link between ilmenite remanence and exchange-bias shift in bimodal low-T ilmenite lamellae is related to different densities of hematite domain walls induced by the clusters of ilmenite lamellae.}},

@article{Robinson:2002aa,
	abstract = {Magnetic anomalies associated with slowly cooled igneous and metamorphic rocks are commonly attributed to the presence of the mineral magnetite. Although the intermediate members of the ilmenite--haematite mineral series can also carry a strong ferrimagnetic remanence1, it is preserved only in rapidly cooled volcanic rocks, where formation of intergrowths of weakly magnetic haematite and paramagnetic ilmenite is suppressed. But the occurrence of unusually large and stable magnetic remanence in rocks containing such intergrowths has been known for decades2,3,4,5, and has recently been the subject of intense investigation6,7,8,9,10. These unmixed oxide phases have been shown to contain pervasive exsolution lamellae with thickness from 100 µm down to about 1 nm (one unit cell). These rocks, many of which contain only a few per cent of such oxides, show natural remanent magnetizations up to 30 A m-1---too strong to be explained even by pure haematite in an unsaturated state11,12. Here we propose a new ferrimagnetic substructure created by ferrous--ferric `contact layers'that reduce charge imbalance along lamellar contacts between antiferromagnetic haematite and paramagnetic ilmenite. We estimate that such a lamellar magnetic material can have a saturation magnetization up to 55 kA m-1---22 times stronger than pure haematite---while retaining the high coercivity and thermal properties of single-domain haematite.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamic models which incorporate the effects of long-range magnetic order are developed for mineral endmembers and their solid solutions. The temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy of solution is obtained from a statistical mechanical description of spin configurations. The non-configurational magnetic Gibbs Free energy is modeled as a Taylor expansion of low order and even degree. Taylor coefficients are calibrated from determinations of magnetic transition temperatures and from heat capacity measurements. The technique is used to derived model equations for the thermodynamic properties of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3) and the solid solution series magnetite-ulv{\"o}spinel (Fe2TiO4) and hematite-ilmenite (FeTiO3). These models are utilized to calculate phase diagrams, and the effect of the interplay between ``magnetic''and ``chemical''ordering is explored. A petrologic application showing the influence of magnetic ordering on temperatures derived from the Fe−Ti oxide geothermometer demonstrates that the effect is significant (a correction on the order of 100 $\,^{\circ}$C) at derived temperatures below the N{\'e}el point for the cubic phase.},

	abstract = {{The R3̅ to R3̅c cation ordering phase transition in the ilmenite (FeTiO3) -- hematite (Fe2O3) solid solution has been investigated using in-situ time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction. Four synthetic samples of the solid solution containing 70, 80, 90, and 100\\% FeTiO3 (ilm70, ilm80, ilm90, and ilm100, respectively) were heated under vacuum to a maximum of 1350 $\,^{\circ}$C. Powder diffraction patterns were collected at several temperatures on heating and cooling, with a Rietveld refinement performed in each case. Samples ilm80, ilm90, and ilm100 were fully ordered after quenching from the synthesis temperature to room temperature. Sample ilm70 had a higher degree of quenched in disorder, which is the result of chemical heterogeneities produced during quenching and subsequent heating in the neutron experiments. The degree of order in all samples decreased smoothly at high temperatures, with second-order transitions to the R3̅c phase being observed at 1000, 1175, and 1325 $\,^{\circ}$C in ilm70, ilm80, and ilm90, respectively. The transition temperature in ilm100 was higher than the maximum temperature reached in the neutron experiments, and is estimated as ~1400 $\,^{\circ}$C. The character of the transition is typical of that predicted by three-dimensional Ising models and appears to become more first-order in character with increasing Ti-content. The temperature-dependence of the cell parameters reveals that components of the spontaneous strain tensor, e11 and e33, are negative and positive, respectively. Little volume strain is associated with long-range ordering. A small negative volume strain due to short-range ordering within the R3̅c phase is identified. The variations in cell parameters and cation-cation distances can be understood in terms of the competing effects of long- and short-range ordering as a function of temperature and composition.}},

	abstract = {{Chemistry of the Fe-Ti oxide minerals in the Bjerkreim-Sokndal layered intrusion and in the Tellnes Ilmenite Norite suggests some parallels in magmatic evolution and resultant petrography. Early ilmenites have high ratios of Mg/(Mg + Fe) and Cr/R3+ and intermediate to low V/R3+, and abundant fine hematite exsolution lamellae, in which Cr, V, and Al are concentrated. Magmatic evolution results in lower Mg/(Mg + Fe), lower Cr/R3+ and higher V/R3+. With magma saturation with magnetite, V/R3+ falls both in ilmenite of rapidly decreasing abundance, and in magnetite, but there is an increase in Mg/(Mg + Fe) of ilmenite, probably due to late ion exchange with much more abundant magnetite. Aside from implications related to magma evolution, these results give information concerning fractionation of elements between the rhombohedral and cubic oxide series, and especially between the ilmenite hosts and their contained hematite exsolution lamellae.}},

	abstract = {{Fe3O4 has been studied by high-pressure diffraction to 43 GPa. No major changes in the spinel-type structure of magnetite is observed below 21.8 GPa. At higher pressure a sluggish transition to a high-pressure modification, h-Fe3O4, is observed. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the high-pressure modification is consistent with the orthorhombic unit cell (CaMn2O4-type structure, space group Pbcm) recently proposed for h-Fe3O4 by Fei et al. (1999), however, it is also consistent with a more symmetric CaTi2O4-type structure (space group Bbmm). Bulk modulus values for magnetite, KT0 = 217 (2) GPa, and h-Fe3O4, KT0 = 202 (7) GPa, are calculated from the pressure-volume data using a third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. A thermodynamic analysis of the Fe-O system at high pressure is presented. The proposed equation of state of h-Fe3O4 gives an increased stability of w{\"u}stite relatively to a two-phase mixture of iron and h-Fe3O4 compared to earlier equations of state and removes an inconsistency in the thermodynamic description of the Fe-O system at high pressure.}},

	abstract = {{Massive, nearly `pure', haemo-ilmenite layers from historic ore deposits in Rogaland, Norway contain very few silicates or other oxides and typically produce remanence-dominated magnetic anomalies. These rocks are ideal for evaluating the magnetic properties of fine exsolution intergrowths and the larger titanohaematite lamellae in the host ilmenite grains. A typical bulk composition, Ilm 84, exsolved at high temperature to produce host ilmenite Ilm 94 and micron-sized haematite lamellae Ilm 23 as measured by electron microprobe (EMP). Subsequent undercooling of the ilmenite and the micron-scale haematite lamellae led to metastable nucleation of nanoscale lamellae down to unit-cell scale, leaving depleted hosts between lamellae with compositions of Ilm 98 and Ilm 15--13 as measured by TEM--EDX. Samples have high coercivities, and average NRM values of 25 A m−1, which typically show ∼2 per cent saturation in the NRM state. The amount of magnetization in these samples is too high to be solely accounted for by a spin-canted AF moment in the haematite. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of haematite--ilmenite interfaces at the atomic scale and on measured rock-magnetic properties, we predict that the magnetization is carried by a ferrimagnetic substructure produced at the contacts of the very fine-scale titanohaematite and ilmenite exsolution lamellae.}},

	abstract = {{The 930-Ma Egersund-Ogna anorthosite is part of the Rogaland igneous complex of massif-type anorthosites intruded into Sveconorwegian basement of southwestern Norway. Average susceptibilities on samples from 13 sites range from 0.03 to 2.24 × 10-3 SI and natural remanent intensities range from 0.004 to 1.54 A m-1. Corresponding Koenigsberger ratios range from 3 to 148 with a mean value of 36, indicating that magnetic field surveys will observe remanent-controlled magnetic anomalies. Optical observations indicate that haemo-ilmenite is the major oxide phase present, with lesser amounts of ilmeno-haematite and rare magnetite. Remanent directions from all samples are characterized by steeply negative inclinations with variable northwest declinations. Thermal demagnetization reveals square-shouldered demagnetization curves with little or no loss of intensity until 550 or 575 $\,^{\circ}$C. Alternating field demagnetization produces a wide range of demagnetization behaviours with mean destructive fields varying from less than 5 mT to greater than 80 mT. There is little evidence for overprinting or secondary components, and all information points to a remanence acquired during initial cooling of the anorthosite at ~ 900 Ma. Mean directional data for the 13 sites are  and . The magnetic pole calculated for Egersund-Ogna is at  latitude and  longitude , in excellent agreement with an earlier pole determined from Egersund, and similar to other poles from Rogaland igneous complex rocks. This work supports Rodinia reconstructions that place Baltica at high (southern) latitude, ~ 70$\,^{\circ}$, at about 900 Ma. Apparent polar wander paths for Baltica at this time are ambiguous and it is difficult to discriminate between proposed clockwise or counter-clockwise loops.}},

	abstract = {{The Proterozoic Lind{\aa}s Nappe, part of the Caledonides of western Norway, was affected by penetrative Sveconorwegian granulite-facies metamorphism, followed by a fluid-driven eclogite- and amphibolite-facies Caledonian overprint, spatially restricted along fractures and shear zones. In mafic granulites and amphibolites, a luminescent anhedral zircon overgrowth, which gives an average age of 924 $\pm$ 58 Ma (Th/U = 0·52; secondary ion mass spectrometry data), surrounds a magmatic zoned core with an age of 952 $\pm$ 32 Ma (Th/U = 1·27). In the granulites, a continuous rim of zircon or a discontinuous corona of ∼10 μm rounded to flat zircon crystals is observed at the outer margin of ilmenite grains. Baddeleyite and srilankite (Ti2ZrO6) blebs are reported around ilmenite included in feldspar or pyroxene. Baddeleyite is interpreted as an exsolution product from magmatic ilmenite, whereas srilankite, the zircon corona around ilmenite and the luminescent zircon overgrowth were formed as reaction products during granulite-facies metamorphism. Textures suggest that magmatic ilmenite was a main source of Zr to form metamorphic zircon. In massive amphibolites, relic ilmenite grains are surrounded by a corona of titanite and a discontinuous corona of micro-zircons. Amphibolite-facies overprint is not associated with any significant growth or dissolution of zircon. An unsheared eclogite displays a zircon population with a euhedral oscillatory zoned overgrowth giving an age of 455 $\pm$ 29 Ma (Th/U ≤ 0·13). A corona of micro-zircon grains is observed at some distance around rutile, and locally these zircons show a prismatic overgrowth. A specific low-Th zircon growth event is related to eclogite-facies forming reactions, involving breakdown of a two-pyroxene + garnet + plagioclase + ilmenite assemblage to form a garnet + omphacite + rutile assemblage in the presence of a fluid. The low Th content of this zircon probably stems from the coeval precipitation of clinozoisite. This oscillatory zoned zircon records fluid infiltration and coeval eclogitization in the crust.}},

	abstract = {This paper reviews findings on the anisotropy of the grain boundary energies. After introducing the basic concepts, there is a discussion of fundamental models used to understand and predict grain boundary energy anisotropy. Experimental methods for measuring the grain boundary energy anisotropy, all of which involve application of the Herring equation, are then briefly described. The next section reviews and compares the results of measurements and model calculations with the goal of identifying generally applicable characteristics. This is followed by a brief discussion of the role of grain boundary energies in nucleating discontinuous transitions in grain boundary structure and chemistry, known as complexion transitions. The review ends with some questions to be addressed by future research and a summary of what is known about grain boundary energy anisotropy.},

	abstract = {An analytical approach to the analysis of zoning profiles in minerals is presented that simultaneously accounts for all of the possible continuous reactions that may be operative in a given assemblage. The method involves deriving a system of simultaneous linear differential equations consisting of a Gibbs-Duhem equation for each phase, a set of linearly independent stoichiometric relations among the chemical potentials of phase components in the assemblage, and a set of equations describing the total differential of the slope of the tangent plane to the Gibbs free energy surface of solid solution phases. The variables are the differentials of T, P, chemical potentials of all phase components, and independent compositional terms of solid solution phases. The required input data are entropies, volumes, the compositions of coexisting phases at a reference P and T, and an expression for the curvature of the Gibbs functions for solid solution phases. Results derived are slopes of isopleths (dP/dT, dX/dT or dX/dP) which can be used to contour P-T diagrams with mineral composition.},

@article{DEVOIR2021116771,
	abstract = {Although garnet is an important accessory phase in many granitic rocks, the petrogenetic history of such garnets is often debated. Explanations range from crystallization from (mostly) peraluminous melts to entrainment of peritectic or xenocrystic garnets originating from country rocks. Here we present a detailed microchemical study of a mid-crustal granodiorite from the Ivrea-Zone (N-Italy), which contains metapelitic enclaves and composite metamorphic-magmatic xeno-phenocryst garnet. Garnets from this locality exhibit high-phosphorus (∼800 ppm) metamorphic cores and multiple igneous overgrowth rims. The high-phosphorus cores appear to originate from granulite facies country-rock, while low-phosphorus rims indicate magmatic overgrowth in two main episodes. Zircon-bearing nanogranitoid inclusions are trapped along embayments between garnet cores and the first magmatic growth zones. Zirconium saturation thermometry indicates a temperature of 820 $\pm$ 5$\,^{\circ}$C during the first magmatic overgrowth, and a temperature of 778 $\pm$ 10$\,^{\circ}$C for the second overgrowth. The latter temperature agrees with garnet-biotite thermometry using the garnet rim composition, which yields a temperature of 773 $\pm$ 29 $\,^{\circ}$C. In order to quantify the duration of the overgrowth episodes, we have numerically modeled Cr, Y, REEs and Hf trace element diffusion, as well as multicomponent major divalent cation diffusion within garnet using available experimental diffusion data and Cr diffusion data retrieved from natural garnets. All modeled diffusants conform to a single temperature-time path, in which the temperatures associated with the first and second magmatic overgrowths persisted for 5.4 and 6.3 kyr, respectively. Composite garnets in Si-rich magmatic systems have the potential to constrain magma transit rates in the continental crust.},

	abstract = {Metagabbro bodies in SW Grenville Province display a variety of disequilibrium corona textures between spinel-clouded plagioclase and primary olivine or opaque oxide. Textural evidence favours a single-stage, subsolidus origin for the olivine coronas and diffusive mass transfer is believed to have been the rate-controlling process. Irreversible thermodynamics have been used to model two different garnet symplectite-bearing corona sequences in terms of steady state diffusion. In the models the flux of each component is related to the chemical potential gradients of all diffusing species by the Onsager or L-coefficients for diffusion. These coefficients are analogous to experimentally determined diffusion coefficients (d), but relate the flux of components to chemical potential rather than concentration gradients.},

@article{Gaidies:2008aa,
	abstract = {We present the software program THERIA{\_}G, which allows for numerical simulation of garnet growth in a given volume of rock along any pressure--temperature--time (P--T--t) path. THERIA{\_}G assumes thermodynamic equilibrium between the garnet rim and the rock matrix during growth and accounts for component fractionation associated with garnet formation as well as for intracrystalline diffusion within garnet. In addition, THERIA{\_}G keeps track of changes in the equilibrium phase relations, which occur during garnet growth along the specified P--T--t trajectory. This is accomplished by the combination of two major modules: a Gibbs free energy minimization routine is used to calculate equilibrium phase relations including the volume and composition of successive garnet growth increments as P and T and the effective bulk rock composition change. With the second module intragranular multi-component diffusion is modelled for spherical garnet geometry. THERIA{\_}G allows to simulate the formation of an entire garnet population, the nucleation and growth history of which is specified via the garnet crystal size frequency distribution. Garnet growth simulations with THERIA{\_}G produce compositional profiles for the garnet porphyroblasts of each size class of a population and full information on equilibrium phase assemblages for any point along the specified P--T--t trajectory. The results of garnet growth simulation can be used to infer the  P--T--t path of metamorphism from the chemical zoning of garnet porphyroblasts. With a hypothetical example of garnet growth in a pelitic rock we demonstrate that it is essential for the interpretation of the chemical zoning of garnet to account for the combined effects of the thermodynamic conditions of garnet growth, the nucleation history and intracrystalline diffusion.},

The presented examples demonstrate that changes in zircon morphology, within single grains and between populations, generally correlate with changes in trace element and Hf-isotope signatures, reflecting the mixing of magmas and changes in the composition of the magma through mingling processes and progressive crystallization. The zircon data show that the I-type Kosciusko tonalite was derived from a single source of crustal origin, whereas the S-type Berridale adamellite had two distinct sources including a significant I-type magma contribution. Complex morphology and Hf isotope variations in zircon grains indicate a moderate contribution from a crustal component in the genesis of the I-type Dundee rhyodacite. The integration of data on morphology, trace elements and Hf isotope variations in zircon populations provides a tool for the detailed analysis of the evolution of individual igneous rocks; it offers new insights into the contributions of different source rocks and the importance of magma mixing in granite petrogenesis. Such information is rarely obtainable from the analysis of bulk rocks.}},

	abstract = {Abstract Grain-scale pressure variations have recently been investigated due to its significant effect on the observed microstructures and chemical redistribution in metamorphic rocks. In this study, the impact of grain-scale pressure variation on a growing garnet grain is investigated. We model prograde garnet growth at fluid-saturated conditions and sufficiently low temperature (<650 $\,^{\circ}$C) to avoid modification of the inner part of the grain by diffusion. The method uses the Perple\_X computer program package combined with Matlab{\textregistered} scripts allowing for a heterogeneous fluid pressure distribution around the growing grain. It is shown that the pressure variation around the grain may result in an asymmetric chemical zonation. Motivated by the result, we apply the model to selected published prograde paths to evaluate the magnitude of the pressure variation that is necessary for the development of the asymmetric zoning preserved in the samples. The magnitude of such a pressure gradient in the selected samples may correspond up to 1 kbar. Finally, it is demonstrated that the modelling of asymmetric chemical zoning in garnet under a pressure gradient may improve the precision of thermobarometric constraints. The numerical model evaluates the effect of the pressure gradient on a growing grain and thus can serve as a benchmark tool in future development of fully coupled models involving rock deformation and mineral reactions.},

As an alternative to treating the problem in terms of `force of crystallization', this paper examines the mechanics of porphyroblast-matrix interaction using a different and much simpler conceptual framework. New microstructural evidence for matrix displacement is then presented and analysed in detail. This evidence, from a hornfelsed metagreywacke, consists of dome-shaped accumulations of muscovite and graphite, each dome being attached to (and concave towards) a rhombdodecahedral face of a garnet porphyroblast. Muscovite within the domes shows a dimensional preferred orientation subparallel to the dome outlines while, in the matrix away from the domes, there is no preferred orientation.},

	abstract = {Rate-limiting processes and the degree of disequilibrium during metamorphic mineral growth are key controls on the rate of dehydration and hydration in the Earth's crust. This paper examines diffusion-controlled growth and the degree of disequilibrium of garnet porphyroblasts in the Tsukuba metamorphic rocks of central Japan. The analyzed porphyroblasts have irregular and branching morphologies with clear diffusional haloes, indicating that they grew in a diffusion-controlled regime. Mathematical analysis shows that the dominant wavelength of the interface of a garnet porphyroblast is dependent on the extent of supersaturation (Δζ), which is an index for the degree of disequilibrium. Using the calculated upper and lower limits of the dominant wavelength, the value of Δζis estimated to be 0.05 ×10−1--0.16, which corresponds to a Gibbs free energy (ΔGr) overstep of 0.9--27 kJ per mole of garnet (12 oxygen atoms) and a temperature overstep (ΔT) of 1.7--50 $\,^{\circ}$C. Using the average value of the dominant wavelength, the following results are obtained: Δζ= 0.15 ×10−1, ΔGr= 2.7 kJ per mole of garnet, and ΔT = 5 $\,^{\circ}$C. These values bring into question the importance of diffusion-controlled growth of garnet porphyroblasts, as highly irregular and branching garnet porphyroblasts are rare in most metamorphic belts. After significant overstepping for the nucleation of garnet, the garnet porphyroblasts grow at a high degree of disequilibrium. However, a high degree of disequilibrium under diffusion-controlled growth would be characterized by diffusional instability. The results indicate that garnet porphyroblasts that lack an irregular and branching morphology may grow at a high degree of disequilibrium under interface-controlled growth, provided they are set in a medium where the diffusion and supply of constituent elements are sufficient, such as a sufficient volume of metamorphic fluid.},

	abstract = {Abstract Chemical zoning in the outer few 10s of microns of garnet porphyroblasts has been investigated to assess the scale of chemical equilibrium with matrix minerals in a pelitic schist. Garnet porphyroblasts from the Late Proterozoic amphibolite facies regional metamorphic mica schists from Glen Roy in the Scottish Highlands contain typical prograde growth zoning patterns. Edge compositions have been measured via a combination of analysis of traverses across the planar edges of porphyroblast surfaces coupled to X-ray mapping of small areas within polished thin sections at the immediate edge of the porphyroblasts. These approaches reveal local variation in garnet composition, especially of grossular (Ca) and almandine (Fe) components, with a range at the edge from <7 mol.\% grs to >16 mol.\% grs, across distances of less than 50 µm. This small-scale patchy compositional zoning is as much variation as the core--rim compositional zoning across the whole of a 3 mm porphyroblast. Ca and Fe heterogeneity occurs on a scale suggesting a combination of inefficient diffusive exchange across grain boundaries during prograde growth and the evolving microtopography of the porphyroblast surface control garnet composition. The latter creates haloes of compositional zoning adjacent to some inclusions, which typically extend from the inclusion towards the porphyroblast edge during further growth. The lack of a consistent equilibrium composition at the garnet edge is also apparent in the internal zoning of the porphyroblast and so processes occurring during entrapment of some mineral inclusions have a profound influence on the overall chemical zoning. Garnet compositions and associated zoning patterns are widely used by petrologists to reconstruct P--T--t paths for crustal rocks. The evidence of extremely localized (10--50 µm scale) equilibrium during growth further undermines these approaches.},

	abstract = {Perthites in slowly cooled granulite facies rocks from the Ngoronghoro structure (Tanzania) show complex microstructures reflecting several stages of exsolution and coarsening. Mesoperthites with an integrated bulk composition of Or26.5Ab71An2.5 are comprised of lamellar intergrowth of 5 to 10 μm wide orthoclase-rich and albite-rich lamellae. Spindle perthites with a bulk composition of Or67Ab31.5An1.5 are comprised of 2 to 10 μm wide and several 10{\textquoteright}s of μm long albite-rich spindles in an orthoclase-rich host. In the mesoperthite primary exsolution occurred by spinodal decomposition, whereas the spindle perthite formed by a nucleation and growth mechanism. The interfaces between the exsolved phases are generally incoherent. Unmixing and coarsening of the mesoperthite is discussed in the light of non-linear uphill diffusion. The microstructure evolution and successive chemical separation of the exsolved phases during cooling are modeled based on Cahn-Hilliard theory. We find that coarsening primarily occurs during the first 20 {\textdegree}C to 30 {\textdegree}C of cooling after the homogeneous precursor feldspar has entered the coherent spinodal. The extent of coarsening and the characteristic size of the exsolved phases depend on the cooling rate over this temperature interval. For geologically relevant cooling rates on the order of 5{\textdegree}C/Ma to 50 {\textdegree}C/Ma the compositions of the exsolved phases develop along the solvus down to about 480 {\textdegree}C to 530 {\textdegree}C and are {\textquotedblleft}frozen in{\textquotedblright} only at lower temperatures. The compositions that are finally preserved in the orthoclase-rich and in the albite-rich phases depend on cooling rate over this temperature interval. Both the characteristic lamella width of the mesoperthite as well as the compositions of the exsolved phases indicate slow cooling at <= 5 {\textdegree}C/Ma during the coarsening stage and down to about 450 {\textdegree}C. During later stages of the cooling history the albite-rich phase of the mesoperthite exsolved about the peristerite gap, and the orthoclase-rich host of the spindle perthite exsolved a second generation of coherent albite-rich spindles. The incoherent phase boundaries of the primary perthite microstructures served as passageways for fluids during late stage deuteric alteration, which lead to secondary coarsening in the mesoperthite and to alteration of the albite-rich precipitates in the spindle perthite. Finally, both types of perthites were replaced by coarse grained patch perthite during deuteric alteration.},

@article{Mancktelow:1998aa,
	abstract = {A backscattered and secondary electron SEM study of the grain boundary microstructure in quartz mylonites sampled along the length of the retrograde Simplon Fault Zone established three characteristic components. (1) Fine isolated pores (≤1 μm diameter) are scattered across two-grain interfaces, preferentially concentrated on surfaces in extension. Pores are uncommon on three-grain junctions and there is no evidence for fluid interconnectivity along three- and four-grain junctions. The fine porosity may develop by accumulation of original, mainly intragranular fluid inclusions to the grain boundary during deformation and recrystallization and by cavitation of grain boundaries during grain boundary sliding. Dynamic cavitation implies that the ``ductile''mylonitic deformation is at least locally dilatant and therefore pressure sensitive. (2) Large ``vug''-like pores (up to mm-scale) extend along multi-grain boundaries. Observed in all samples, they are most common in the higher initial temperature, coarse-grained samples with a microstructure dominated by grain boundary migration recrystallization. Grains bordering this connected porosity develop perfect crystal faces, undecorated by fine pores or pits. The irregular ``lobate''optical microstructure of many migrating grain boundaries actually consists of a series of straight crystal faces. The coarse porosity is probably due to accumulation during dynamic recrystallization of (CO2-rich ?) fluid with a high wetting angle against quartz. (3) In one sample, interconnected sinuous ridges, ≤0.2 μm high, are observed to follow three- and four-grain junctions and disjoint into more isolated worms and spheroidal globules. On two-grain interfaces, these are transitional to more branching vein-like or convoluted brain-like forms. The brain-like and globular forms have been observed, with varying frequency, through the range of samples, with the globules attaining sizes of up to 60 μm. Vein structures have also been observed on intragranular fractures. These topologies do not match across adjoining surfaces and must have developed into free space. The ridge-vein-brain-spheroid structure is distinctly different to that previously observed on experimentally healed microcracks and its origin is not unequivocally established. They could represent unstable meniscus necking of a thin grain-boundary phase of low viscosity, developed due to quasi-adiabatic shear and/or local stress-induced dilatancy during microcracking.},

@article{Kusama:2017aa,
	abstract = {Producing a single crystal is expensive because of low mass productivity. Therefore, many metallic materials are being used in polycrystalline form, even though material properties are superior in a single crystal. Here we show that an extraordinarily large Cu-Al-Mn single crystal can be obtained by abnormal grain growth (AGG) induced by simple heat treatment with high mass productivity. In AGG, the sub-boundary energy introduced by cyclic heat treatment (CHT) is dominant in the driving pressure, and the grain boundary migration rate is accelerated by repeating the low-temperature CHT due to the increase of the sub-boundary energy. With such treatment, fabrication of single crystal bars 70 cm in length is achieved. This result ensures that the range of applications of shape memory alloys will spread beyond small-sized devices to large-scale components and may enable new applications of single crystals in other metallic and ceramics materials having similar microstructural features.},

	abstract = {Conventional models for grain growth are based on the assumption that grain boundary (GB) velocity is proportional to GB mean curvature. We demonstrate via a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that such a model is inadequate and that many physical phenomena occur during grain boundary migration for which this simple model is silent. We present a series of MD simulations designed to unravel GB migration phenomena and set it in a GB migration context that accounts for competing migration mechanisms, elasticity, temperature, and grain boundary crystallography. The resultant formulation is quantitative and validated through a series of atomistic simulations. The implications of this model for microstructural evolution is described. We show that consideration of GB migration mechanisms invites considerable complexity even under ideal conditions. However, that complexity also grants these systems enormous flexibility, and that flexibility is key to the decades-long success of conventional grain growth theories.},

	abstract = {Abstract Relationships between the recrystallized grain size and stress are investigated for experimentally deformed water-added quartz aggregates. For stresses ≥100 MPa there is a variation in the measured recrystallized grain size for a given stress. This variation correlates with a change in the c-axis fabric in general shear experiments, where samples with larger recrystallized grain sizes for a given stress have dominantly prism <a> c-axis fabrics and samples with smaller recrystallized grain sizes for a given stress have dominantly basal <a> c-axis fabrics. The dislocation creep flow law also changes at conditions where these two c-axis fabrics form (Tokle et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2018.10.017). Using the wattmeter model (Austin \& Evans, 2007, https://doi.org/10.1130/G23244A.1), different piezometric relationships are quantified for samples that develop prism <a> and basal <a> c-axis fabrics, respectively. The wattmeter model is sensitive to grain growth kinetics; a new grain growth law for quartz is formulated based on reanalysis of microstructures in samples from previous work. The activation enthalpies and water fugacity exponents for our grain growth law and dislocation creep flow laws are the same within error, suggesting the recrystallized grain size versus stress relationships are nearly independent of temperature and water fugacity, consistent with laboratory observations. The wattmeters successfully predict the recrystallized grain size versus stress relationships of all quartzite samples from experiments with added water. These results support the use and extrapolation of the wattmeter model for both experimental and geologic conditions to investigate the stress state and grain size evolution of quartz rich rocks.},

	abstract = {The Sambagawa metamorphic rocks in central Shikoku, southwest Japan consist of an inverted metamorphic sequence from the upper chlorite to oligoclase-biotite zones at the lower structural level (LSL), which is overlain by a normal metamorphic sequence consisting of the albite-biotite and garnet zones at the upper structural level (USL). These sequences form a large-scale recumbent fold called the Besshi nappe. To unravel the mechanism of recrystallization and physical conditions in quartz, and their relation to exhumation tectonics, microstructures of recrystallized quartz grains in quartz schist from the Asemi-Saruta-Dozan River traverse were analyzed. The recrystallized quartz grain size increases with increasing structural level from 40 µm in the upper chlorite zone to 160 µm in the garnet zone of the USL. Further, the mechanism of dynamic recrystallization of quartz changes from subgrain rotation to grain boundary migration with increasing structural level across the uppermost garnet zone of the LSL. From these data, the deformation temperatures in quartz schist are calculated to increase with increasing structural level within the range between 300 and 450 $\,^{\circ}$C using paleopiezometers and experimental flow laws. It could be interpreted that a rapid cooling of the Besshi nappe from above is responsible for the deformation temperatures recorded in quartz schist.},

	abstract = {Hydrous fluids play a vital role in the chemical and rheological evolution of ductile, quartz-bearing continental crust, where fluid percolation pathways are controlled by grain boundary domains. In this study, widths of grain boundary domains in seven quartzite samples metamorphosed under varying crustal conditions were investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) which allows comparatively easy, high magnification imaging and precise width measurements. It is observed that dynamic recrystallization at higher metamorphic grades is much more efficient at reducing grain boundary widths than at lower temperature conditions. The concept of force-distance spectroscopy, applied to geological samples for the first time, allows qualitative estimation of variations in the strength of grain boundary domains. The strength of grain boundary domains is inferred to be higher in the high grade quartzites, which is supported by Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) studies using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). The results of the study show that quartzites deformed and metamorphosed at higher grades have narrower channels without pores and an abundance of periodically arranged bridges oriented at right angles to the length of the boundary. We conclude that grain boundary domains in quartz-rich rocks are more resistant to fluid percolation in the granulite rather than the greenschist facies.},

	abstract = {The present contribution summarizes the results of a study focusing on the influence of quartz microstructures on the seismic wave velocities in the quartzites of the Garhwal Himalaya. Quartzites being monomineralic were chosen for the present study so as to nullify the effect of other mineral constituents on the seismic velocity. Samples were collected from different tectonic settings of the Higher and Lesser Himalayas which are separated from one another by the major tectonic zone `Main Central Thrust'(MCT). These are mainly Pandukeshwar quartzite, Tapovan quartzite and Berinag quartzite. The samples of Berinag quartzite were collected from near the klippen and the thrust, termed as Alaknanda Thrust. The vast differences in microstructures and associated seismic wave velocities have been noted in different quartzites. It has also been observed that quartzites of the MCT zone and Alaknanda Thrust have higher seismic velocities. This is because of their coarse-grained nature of the rocks as evidenced by the strong positive relation between seismic velocities and grain area. The coarsening is either due to the operation of grain boundary migration and grain area reduction process or high aspect ratio/shape preferred orientation. The quartzites located around Nandprayag Klippen have undergone static recrystallization and exhibit the lowest seismic wave velocities.},

	abstract = {Abstract The three-dimensional disposition of cordierite and biotite crystals in a hornfels from the contact aureole of the Bugaboo Batholith is quantified using high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography and global as well as scale-dependent pattern statistics. The results demonstrate a random distribution of cordierite and biotite crystal sizes for all scales across the entire rock volume studied indicative of interface-controlled prograde metamorphic reaction kinetics. The reaction considered responsible for the mineral assemblage and the formation of cordierite and biotite in the hornfels is Ms + Chl + Qtz = Crd + And + Bt + . Rock-specific phase equilibria point to metamorphic conditions of ~520 --550 $\,^{\circ}$C and 3 kbar for this reaction. The common approach to approximate the shape of crystals as spherical underestimates the influence of the Strauss hard-core process on rock texture and may be misinterpreted to reflect ordering of crystal sizes by inhibition of nucleation and growth commonly associated with diffusion-controlled reaction kinetics. According to our findings, Strauss hard-core ordering develops at length scales equal to and less than the average major axis of the crystal population. This is significantly larger than what is obtained if a spherical crystal geometry would be assumed, and increases with deviation from sphericity. For the cordierite and biotite populations investigated in this research, Strauss hard-core ordering developed at length scales of up to ∼2.2 and 1.25 mm, respectively, which is almost 1 mm longer than the scales that would be obtained if a spherical geometry would have been assumed. Our results highlight the importance of a critical assessment of the geometrical model assumptions commonly applied in the three-dimensional analysis of crystal size distributions, and underline the need for a quantitative understanding of interface processes in order to appreciate their role in the kinetics of contact metamorphic reactions and rock texture formation.},

	abstract = {Abstract The mechanisms that govern porphyroblast crystallization are investigated by comparing quantitative textural data with predictions from different crystallization models. Such numerical models use kinetic formulations of the main crystallization mechanism to predict textural characteristics, such as grain size distributions. In turn, data on porphyroblast textures for natural samples are used to infer which mechanism dominated during their formation. Whereas previous models assume that the rate-limiting step for a porphyroblast producing reaction is either transport or growth, the model advanced in this study considers the production of nutrients for porphyroblasts as a potentially rate-limiting factor. This production reflects the breakdown of (metastable) reactants, which at a specific pressure (P) and temperature (T) depends on the bulk composition of the sample. The production of nutrients that potentially contribute to the formation of porphyroblasts is computed based on thermodynamic models. The conceptual model assumes that these nutrients feed into some intergranular medium, and products form by nutrient consumption from that medium, with rates depending on reaction affinity. For any sequence of P--T conditions along a P--T--t path, the numerical model first computes an effective supersaturation (σeff) of the product phase(s), then an effective nucleation rate (J), and finally the amount of (porphyroblast) growth. As a result, the model is useful in investigating how the textural characteristics of a sample (of given bulk composition) depend on the P--T--t path followed during porphyroblast crystallization. The numerical model is tested and validated by comparing simulation results with quantitative textural data for garnet porphyroblasts measured in samples from the Swiss Central Alps.},

The development of high-tech materials requires functional, multicomponent microstructures including multilayers, designed, processed and controlled at the micron and nanometer levels. It is now quite well recognized that to optimize and design materials for specified properties, materials are best utilized as composites. The nature of the components, their structures, morphologies and interfacial characteristics are most important. In particular, multilayered nano-structures are attractive for mechanical and many functional properties (e.g. magnetic). In order to understand the properties of any such multilayered system, and hence to be able to design pre-determined sets of properties, it is necessary to know their structure. For this reason, characterization of physical, chemical, and magnetic structures at relevant length scales is of particular importance. In this paper, attention is drawn to multilayered retained austenite/martensite (γret/MS) steels and multilayered Co/Pt films for high density magnetic recording.},

@article{Anderson:2007aa,
	abstract = {Clinopyroxene + plagioclase ($\pm$Hbl $\pm$Qtz) symplectites after omphacite are widely cited as evidence for prior eclogite-facies or high-pressure (HP) metamorphism. Precursor omphacite compositions of retrograde eclogites, used for reconstructing retrograde P--T paths, are commonly estimated by reintegrating symplectite phases with the assumption that the symplectite-forming reactions were isochemical. Comparisons of broadbeam symplectite compositions to adjacent unreacted pyroxene from various symplectites after clinopyroxene from the Appalachian Blue Ridge (ABR) and Western Gneiss Region (WGR) suggest that the symplectite forming reactions are largely isochemical. Endmember calculations based on reintegrated symplectite compositions from the ABR and WGR suggest that a minor Ca-Eskola (CaEs) component (XCaEs = 0.04--0.15) was present in precursor HP clinopyroxene. WGR symplectites consist of fine-grained (∼1 μm-scale), vermicular intergrowths of Pl + Cpx II $\pm$Hbl that occur at grain boundaries or internally. ABR symplectites contain coarser (∼10 μm-scale) planar lamellae and rods of Pl + Cpx II + Qtz + Hbl within clinopyroxene cores. The contrasting textures correlate with decompression and cooling rate, and degree of overstepping of the retrograde reaction (lamellar: slow, erosionally controlled exhumation with slow/low overstepping; fine-grained, grainboundary symplectite: rapid, tectonic exhumation with rapid/high overstepping). Variations in XCaEs, Xjd, and XCaTs of precursor HP omphacite are related to the symplectic mineral assemblages that result from decompression. Quartz-normative symplectities indicate quartz-producing retrograde reactions (e.g., breakdown of precursor CaEs); quartz-free symplectities (e.g., diopside + plagioclase after omphacite) indicate quartz-consuming reactions (jd, CaTs breakdown) outpaced quartz-producing reactions.},

	abstract = {Phase separation in a three-component system that results from the uphill diffusion of chemical components is considered. The binary decomposition model of Cahn and Hilliard is generalized to account for the interdiffusion of several chemical components with considerably different diffusion constants. Thereafter the decomposition dynamics and the phase relations of the final system state are investigated by means of finite-element modeling. Examples from a hypothetical regular solution and from ternary feldspar are addressed. Special attention is given to situations in which different diffusivities affect decomposition dynamics and the final system states. Good qualitative agreement between our modeling and petrographic observations on exsolved feldspar is achieved. Our model explains systematic deviations from equilibrium element partitioning between the two phases exsolving from an initially homogeneous ternary feldspar during slow cooling.},

@article{Abart:2009aa,
	abstract = {Feldspar megacrysts from the Weinsberg granite (Moldanubian Zone) show oscillatory zoning with respect to the albite- and orthoclase components. All growth zones show perthitic exsolutions which take the form of bleb- and lens shaped albite-rich precipitates in an orthoclase-rich host. The average sizes and shapes of the precipitates show systematic variation with the integrated bulk compositions of the respective growth zones. The precipitates are abundant and relatively small in growth zones with intermediate bulk composition (Or50Ab41An09 - Or80Ab18An02), and they are less abundant and larger in more orthoclase-rich zones (Or88Ab11An01). Small precipitates have a relatively high aspect ratio, whereas the large precipitates in the potassium-rich zones are more spherical. The relation between microstructure and integrated bulk composition suggests that exsolution and subsequent growth and coarsening occurred by different mechanisms in the respective growth zones. Numerical modeling shows that rapid growth of precipitates over extended periods of time and attainment of relatively large final size is favored, if only few nuclei are formed in an oversaturated host. In contrast, precipitates can grow rapidly only over limited time intervals and remain relatively small, if abundant nuclei are present. During cooling of the oscillatorily zoned alkali-feldspar, exsolution started at relatively high temperatures in growth zones of intermediate integrated bulk composition as compared to exsolution in the more orthoclase-rich growth zones. Irrespective of whether exsolution occurred by spinodal decomposition or by nucleation at relatively high temperatures in the growth zones of intermediate integrated bulk composition, it produced abundant nuclei and resulted in relatively small precipitates. In contrast, comparatively few nuclei were formed in the orthoclase-rich growth zones resulting in large precipitates. The Na/K partitioning between precipitates and the host is independent of the integrated bulk composition of the respective growth zone reflecting re-equilibration during cooling down to relatively low temperatures (< 400$\,^{\circ}$C). The shape of the precipitates probably has evolved from an initially lamellar or spindle-like geometry with high aspect ratio to more isometric, spheroidal shapes during precipitate growth and coarsening. Host/precipitate interfaces served as fluid pathways during late stage deuteric alteration.},

	abstract = {Abstract Calcite--dolomite solvus geothermometry is a versatile method for the estimation of metamorphic temperature because of its simplicity. However, in medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks the accuracy of estimating temperature by the integration of unmixed dolomite and calcite is hampered by the heterogeneous distribution of unmixed dolomite, difficulties in distinguishing between preexisting and exsolved dolomite and demarcating grain boundaries. In this study, it is shown that calcite--dolomite solvus thermometry can be applied to calcite inclusions in forsterite and spinel for the estimation of peak metamorphic temperature in granulite facies marbles from Skallevikshalsen, East Antarctica. The marbles are comprised of a granoblastic mineral assemblage of calcite + dolomite + forsterite + diopside + spinel + phlogopite $\pm$ apatite, characteristic of granulite facies metamorphic conditions. Forsterite, spinel and apatite frequently contain `negative crystal' inclusions of carbonates that display homogeneously distributed dolomite lamellae. On the basis of narrow ranges of temperature (850--870 $\,^{\circ}$C) recorded from carbonate inclusions compared with the range from matrix carbonate it is regarded that the inclusion carbonates represent a closed system. Furthermore, this estimate is consistent with dolomite--graphite carbon isotope geothermometry, and is considered to be the best estimate of peak metamorphic temperature for this region. Matrix calcite records different stages of retrograde metamorphism and re-equilibration of calcite that continued until Mg diffusion ceased at ∼460 $\,^{\circ}$C. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) results together with morphological features of unmixed coarse tabular dolomite suggest anisotropic diffusion and mineral growth are influenced by crystallographic orientation. Identification of sub-grain boundaries and formation of fine-grained unmixing in calcite rims suggest the presence of grain boundary fluids in the late retrograde stages of metamorphic evolution. These results, thus, demonstrate the usefulness of carbonate inclusion geothermometry in estimating the peak metamorphic temperatures of high-grade terranes and the application of EBSD in understanding the unmixing behaviour of minerals with solid solutions.},

	abstract = {We present a natural element method to treat higher-order spatial derivatives in the Cahn--Hilliard equation. The Cahn--Hilliard equation is a fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation that allows to model phase separation in binary mixtures. Standard classical {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}C{\}}{\}}\^{}0{\}}{\$}{\$}-continuous finite element solutions are not suitable because primal variational formulations of fourth-order operators are well-defined and integrable only if the finite element basis functions are piecewise smooth and globally {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}C{\}}{\}}\^{}1{\}}{\$}{\$}-continuous. To ensure {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}C{\}}{\}}\^{}1{\}}{\$}{\$}-continuity, we develop a natural-element-based spatial discretization scheme. The {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}C{\}}{\}}\^{}1{\}}{\$}{\$}-continuous natural element shape functions are achieved by a transformation of the classical Farin interpolant, which is basically obtained by embedding Sibsons natural element coordinates in a Bernstein--B{\'e}zier surface representation of a cubic simplex. For the temporal discretization, we apply the (second-order accurate) trapezoidal time integration scheme supplemented with an adaptively adjustable time step size. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the computational algorithm in two dimensions. Both periodic Dirichlet and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are applied. Also constant and degenerate mobilities are considered. We demonstrate that the use of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}C{\}}{\}}\^{}1{\}}{\$}{\$}-continuous natural element shape functions enables the computation of topologically correct solutions on arbitrarily shaped domains.},

@article{Kuhl:2007aa,
	abstract = {A new finite element based simulation technique for mineral growth governed by the classical Cahn--Hilliard equation is presented. The particular format of the underlying Flory--Huggins free energy for non-ideal mixtures is characterized through a double-well potential. It allows for uphill diffusion driven by gradients in the chemical potential and thus provides the appropriate framework to simulate phase separation typically encountered in mineral unmixing and growth. For the finite element discretization, the governing fourth order diffusion equation is reformulated in terms of a system of two coupled second order equations. For the temporal discretization, a heuristic adaptive time stepping scheme is applied in order to simulate not only the early stages of phase separation but also the long term behavior of ageing and grain fusion. The basic features of the Cahn--Hilliard equation are elaborated by means of selected geologically relevant examples. In particular, isotropic and anisotropic mineral growth and symplectite formation are studied and the long term response in the sense of Ostwald ripening is illustrated.},

	abstract = {The asymptotic growth form of a two-dimensional nucleus on a fact is derived in terms of the mobility and the free energy density of a step. With a correction of the order of rc/r, where rc is the size of a critical nucleus and r the current nucleus size, the mobility determines the shape. This shape is known as the shape-preserving solution of a kinetic equation, and its size seales with time. Significant deviation is seen at the angular corners of this shape: the shapes of the corners are modified by the surface tension force and approach some final forms. The form of a polygonal growth spiral is also analyzed.},

@article{ANDERSEN2019102899,
	abstract = {The distribution pattern of U-Pb ages of detrital zircon in a sedimentary rock is commonly assumed to reflect the ages of igneous or metamorphic processes in rocks that have contributed material to the sedimentary basin (i.e. the protosources), directly or through recycling of older sedimentary rocks. If the Pb isotopic composition of detrital zircon is modified by processes after crystallization, or influenced by unintended effects of data treatment such as discordance filters and common lead correction, the value of detrital zircon as geological indicator is compromised. Discordance filters will identify zircons having suffered recent lead loss, but significant amounts of ancient lead loss may pass undetected. Lead loss events after the zircon's primary crystallization can be induced by regional or contact metamorphism, but also by low temperature processes during diagenesis and weathering, and can be coupled to uptake of a mixture of common lead and unsupported radiogenic lead, which cannot be properly corrected by common‑lead correction routines. Concealed ancient lead loss and overcorrection for common 207Pb may cause bias towards lower ages, while remaining within acceptable discordance limits. This creates spurious age fractions that may give false indications of sedimentary provenance, invalidate estimates of maximum limits for the age of deposition, and cause problems for comparison and correlation studies based on detrital zircon age data. Careful scrutiny of all U-Pb analyses in combination with Hf isotope analysis may help identifying these effects in detrital zircon data, but will not provide a universal guarantee against biased age spectra.},

@article{VERMEESCH2013140,
	abstract = {The petrography and geochronology of detrital minerals form rich archives of information pertaining to the provenance of siliclastic sediments. The composition and age spectra of multi-sample datasets can be used to trace the flow of sediments through modern and ancient sediment routing systems. Such studies often involve dozens of samples comprising thousands of measurements. Objective interpretation of such large datasets can be challenging and greatly benefits from dimension-reducing exploratory data analysis tools. Principal components analysis (PCA) is a proven method that has been widely used in the context of compositional data analysis and traditional heavy mineral studies. Unfortunately, PCA cannot be readily applied to geochronological data, which are rapidly overtaking petrographic techniques as the method of choice for large scale provenance studies. This paper proposes another standard statistical technique called multidimensional scaling (MDS) as an appropriate tool to fill this void. MDS is a robust and flexible superset of PCA which makes fewer assumptions about the data. Given a table of pairwise `dissimilarities' between samples, MDS produces a `map' of points on which `similar' samples cluster closely together, and `dissimilar' samples plot far apart. It is shown that the statistical effect size of the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test is a viable dissimilarity measure. This is not the case for the p-values of this and other tests. To aid in the adoption of the method by the geochronological community, this paper includes some simple code using the statistical programming language R. More extensive software tools are provided on http://mudisc.london-geochron.com.},

	abstract = {Multidimensional scaling (or MDS) is a methodology for producing geometric models of proximities data. Multidimensional scaling has a long history in political science research. However, most applications of MDS are purely descriptive, with no attempt to assess stability or sampling variability in the scaling solution. In this article, we develop a bootstrap resampling strategy for constructing confidence regions in multidimensional scaling solutions. The methodology is illustrated by performing an inferential multidimensional scaling analysis on data from the 2004 American National Election Study (ANES). The bootstrap procedure is very simple, and it is adaptable to a wide variety of MDS models. Our approach enhances the utility of multidimensional scaling as a tool for testing substantive theories while still retaining the flexibility in assumptions, model details, and estimation procedures that make MDS so useful for exploring structure in data.},

	abstract = {We address the questions: are the temperature and thermodynamic pressure significantly different for thermodynamic equilibrium under hydrostatic versus non-hydrostatic stresses? Moreover, is the nature of the equilibrium state comprising the number of phases and their microstructure different? Only closed thermodynamic systems are considered involving both fluid present and fluid absent mineral reactions. Distinctions are drawn between hydrostatic, fluid, mechanical and thermodynamic pressures. The thermodynamic pressure is always equal to the mechanical pressure (the mean stress) for a linear elastic material but differs from the mechanical pressure if processes involving dissipative volume changes operate. The fundamental principle governing equilibrium in a crystalline aggregate under a non-hydrostatic stress at a given temperature and mean stress is that the elastic energy be minimised. This can be attained in a vast number of ways that involve changes in chemical composition and crystalline structure, as in the growth of garnet on biotite, subtle changes in chemical composition, as in a solid solution series or an order--disorder transition, microstructural rearrangements, as in subgrain formation, and combinations of all of these as in myrmekite formation. All involve changes in the elastic energy of the system and force a new conceptual approach to the definition of a phase and a phase diagram. A microstructural phase rule needs to be considered in conjunction with a mineral phase diagram. For practical purposes the thermodynamic pressure generally is close to the mean stress. A chemical potential for a stressed solid can always be defined if diffusive processes operate. For solid/fluid systems the difference in conditions defining equilibrium for hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic conditions is a second order effect; multiple equilibrium states can exist. Departures from hydrostatic conditions are marked by the form of the phase rule (that is, the topology of the phase diagram) and hence there must be either changes in the Clapeyron slope or the position of the equilibrium phase boundary unless all the modifications to the phase rule are achieved by microstructural rearrangements and subtle changes in chemical composition. For solid/solid systems the shift in equilibrium conditions for non-hydrostatic stresses can, in principle, be very large but such effects can be mitigated by softening of the elastic moduli at phase transitions and are also limited by the difference between the mean stress and the equilibrium hydrostatic pressure. For natural situations the difference between the non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic equilibrium temperature is not likely to exceed 20K. For non-hydrostatic conditions if soft mode nucleation and growth processes dominate, departures from hydrostatic conditions are again marked by changes in the form of the phase rule. Departures in the phase rule from hydrostatic conditions in both fluid present and fluid absent reactions are expressed as variations in chemical composition and differences in the number of phases and their microstructural arrangements at equilibrium under non-hydrostatic as opposed to hydrostatic conditions. The types of microstructures expected at equilibrium under non-hydrostatic conditions include those well documented as arising from internal ``spontaneous'' stresses in crystals as well as distinct new mineral phases. If the couplings between elastic lattice distortions and diffusive processes, or plastic deformation, are strong then softening modes are suppressed or enhanced and large departures from the hydrostatic Clapeyron slope are possible.},

@article{HOFFMANN2015609,
	abstract = {Growing empirical evidence shows that many geomorphic systems are in transient state or out of equilibrium with respect to the external driving forces. The transient state is often related to the (dis)connectivity of the many constituent parts of geomorphic systems as a result of sediment storage along the sediment flow path from its source to the final sink. The response time of geomorphic systems to external changes is thus dependent on the residence time of sediment in various storage compartments. Here, I present a mathematical concept based on reservoir theory to model residence time of sediment using millennial scale sediment budgets. The framework sheds light on the limitation of the sediment delivery ratio, which is often used as a measure of sediment connectivity in geomorphic systems, and provides analytical information on process type, pace of sediment flux and connectivity of storage compartments along the sediment cascade. The application of the reservoir theory to geomorphic systems under agricultural land use shows that sediment delivery ratios are linked to the virtual velocity of the eroded sediment, the time since the onset of agricultural land use and the size of the studied basins. With respect to the temporal evolution of sediment storages that temporarily remove sediment from the conveyor belt, the framework aims to estimate the sediment residence time in storages, which is linked to the effective time scale of disconnectivity. Reanalysis of a long-term empirical sediment budget from Central Europe reveals that the response to agricultural land use, which started ~5000yearsBP, is mainly buffered by the long residence time of sediment on hillslopes (in the order of 103years), which results in a delayed floodplain aggradation. Furthermore, the framework was applied to paraglacial mountain systems that inherit striking evidences of Pleistocene glacial erosion and still recover from the change from glacial to interglacial conditions as a consequence of the reduced lateral and longitudinal connectivity. I show that paraglacial response times of sediment flux in mountain headwater in the Canadian Rocky Mountains range in the order of 100--400ka. The results indicate that response times at the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions are much longer than the return interval of the major glaciations, causing a transient behavior of mountain headwater basins during interglacial periods. The presented reanalysis of millennial-scale sediment budgets of agricultural and mountain geosystems provides an integrative framework to link paleo-environmental reconstructions and the connectivity of transient geomorphic system to external changes.},

	abstract = {Variation in zircon trace element (TE) and isotopic composition data have been used to infer changes in global-scale processes; however, few studies have explored zircon TE data as a comprehensive means to track regional shifts in tectonic regimes. In this contribution, we explore the utility of zircon TE data to record the well-documented Late Paleozoic--Mesozoic tectonic history in Southeast Asia, which includes transitions from continental magmatism to island-arc extension, subsequent compression and island-arc accretion, and finally continental collision. We present new U-Pb ages, along with Lu-Hf isotopic and TE data, from 2,478 detrital zircon grains extracted from 17 modern river sediment samples collected across two major suture zones in Thailand. Our results show that zircon Th/U and Nb/Ta mean values increase after ∼300Ma, whereas the percentage of classified `felsic' zircon decline corresponding with the initiation of Nan back-arc basin extension and isolation of the Sukhothai Arc from Indochina. From ∼255 to 235 Ma, zircon εHf(t), LREE/HREE, (Eu/Eu*)N, (Ce/Ce*)N, Nb/Ta, and Th/U mean values decline, whereas Dy/Yb, U/Yb, and the proportion of classified S-type and `felsic' zircon increase, showing the transition from I-type to S-type, and from more juvenile to more evolved magmatism. This transition reflects a shift from arc extension to compression via the closure of the Nan back-arc basin and the collision of the Sukhothai Arc with western Indochina, and the subsequent collision of Sibumasu with the Sukhothai Arc demarking the regional closure of the Paleo-Tethys ocean. Our data also show linear correlations between εHf(t)-DM and trace elemental data, particularly (Eu/Eu*)N, that reflect increasing sediment contamination within the melts. Lastly, our data illustrate that the Sibumasu--Sukhothai Arc collided ∼20 million years earlier in Thailand than in the Malay Peninsula, demonstrating along-strike diachroneity in Paleo-Tethys closure. Thus, time-integrated detrital zircon TE data may reliably track subduction slab dynamics and tectonic evolution beyond U-Pb and Hf isotope data alone.},

@article{BARHAM2022117425,
	abstract = {The fertility and heterogeneity of source rocks play important roles in determining the age distribution of detrital zircon populations that accumulate in sedimentary basins. Detrital zircon samples in active convergent tectonic settings are typified by a dominance of well-defined young age modes associated with an arc/magmatic orogenic belt, while passive margins and extensional settings more commonly express dispersed polymodal age populations reflecting more extensive, geologically heterogeneous catchments and greater sediment recycling. Two newly defined metrics relating to (i) the temporal difference between the 10th and 50th percentiles of a detrital zircon age population, and (ii) a modified χ2-distribution analysis of age population modality and dispersion, provide a powerful means of distinguishing between geologically active convergent systems and divergent/passive margin basins. Importantly, this tool does not require knowledge of depositional age. This ``age distribution fingerprint'' is assessed in three distinct Cenozoic to Proterozoic case-studies to demonstrate the tectonic resolution of the approach and potential in refining views of basin evolution. The age distribution fingerprint offers the ability to characterize sediment routing histories and investigate tectonic settings since the onset of subduction related plate tectonics, even where stratigraphic constraints are lacking.},

Convergent plate margins are characterized by a large proportion of zircon ages close to the depositional age of the sediment, whereas sediments in collisional, extensional and intracratonic settings contain greater proportions with older ages that reflect the history of the underlying basement. These differences can be resolved by plotting the distribution of the difference between the measured crystallization ages (CA) of individual zircon grains present in the sediment and the depositional age (DA) of the sediment. Application of this approach to successions where the original nature of the basin and/or the link to source are no longer preserved constrains the tectonic setting in which the sediment was deposited.}},

	abstract = {We here present the first comprehensive provenance study of the Sahara Desert using a combination of multiple provenance proxies and state-of-the-art statistical analysis. Our dataset comprises 44 aeolian-dune samples, collected across the region from 12$\,^{\circ}$N (Nigeria) to 34$\,^{\circ}$N (Tunisia) and from 33$\,^{\circ}$E (Egypt) to 16$\,^{\circ}$W (Mauritania) and characterized by bulk-petrography, heavy-mineral, and detrital-zircon UPb geochronology analyses. A set of statistical tools including Multidimensional Scaling, Correspondence Analysis, Individual Difference Scaling, and General Procrustes Analysis was applied to discriminate among sample groups with the purpose to reveal meaningful compositional patterns and infer sediment transport pathways on a geological scale. The overall homogenity across sand samples, however, precluded a detailed narrative. Saharan dune fields are, with a few local exceptions, composed of pure quartzose sand with very poor heavy-mineral suites dominated by durable zircon, tourmaline, and rutile. Some feldspars, amphibole, epidote, garnet, or staurolite occur closer to basement exposures, and carbonate grains, clinopyroxene and olivine near a basaltic field in Libya. Relatively varied compositions also characterize sand along the Nile Valley and the southern front of the Anti-Atlas fold belt in Morocco. Otherwise, from the Sahel to the Mediterranean Sea and from the Nile River to the Atlantic Ocean, sand consists nearly exclusively of quartz and durable minerals. These have been concentrated through multiple cycles of erosion, deposition, and diagenesis of Phanerozoic siliciclastic rocks during the long period of relative tectonic quiescence that followed the Neoproterozoic Pan-African orogeny, the last episode of major crustal growth in the region. The principal ultimate source of recycled sand is held to be represented by the thick blanket of quartz-rich sandstones that were deposited in the Cambro-Ordovician from the newly formed Arabian-Nubian Shield in the east to Mauritania in the west. Durability of zircon grains and their likelihood to be recycled from older sedimentary rocks argues against the assumption, too often implicitly taken for granted in provenance studies based on detrital-zircon ages, that their age distribution reflects transport pathways existing at the time of deposition rather than inheritance from multiple and remote landscapes of the past.},

	abstract = {Sediment Routing Systems (SRS) and Sediment Generation (SG) are two branches of sedimentary geology which are complementary, although their full integration remains incomplete. SRS connect all the steps of the journey of sediments from their formation to final deposition in relation to the denudation of sediment sources, the transfer of erosional products and their final deposition. SG is a branch of provenance analysis focussing on the quantification of the processes governing the production (Qs) and dispersal of sediments from known parent rocks, and the prediction of the amount and compositional-textural properties of sediments produced under given tectonic and climatic settings. The integration of the two disciplines is fundamental to tackle some of the open problems in sedimentary geology, including (i) the dynamics regulating the generation and release of sediments from upstream catchments to the floodplains, (ii) particle trajectories, (iii) residence time and mineralogical modifications in temporary storage environments (iv) sediment selective extraction and (v) the shredding of environmental signal propagation in both (vi) actualistic and deep-time SRS. I introduce all the elements which are necessary to both disciplines, with particular emphasis on quantitative provenance analysis (QPA). The SG approach is required to quantify lithological controls on Qs, and include it into the stream power law. QPA and the `Provenance Toolbox' provide the compositional framework which is necessary for the characterisation of the erosional products. Both the advantages and limitations of each analytical tool are explored, and best practices for successful analytical workflows are discussed in light of a full integration into SRS research.},

	abstract = {{The increase in detrital geochronological data presents challenges to existing approaches to data visualization and comparison, and highlights the need for quantitative techniques able to evaluate and compare multiple large data sets. We test five metrics commonly used as quantitative descriptors of sample similarity in detrital geochronology: the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and Kuiper tests, as well as Cross-correlation, Likeness, and Similarity coefficients of probability density plots (PDPs), kernel density estimates (KDEs), and locally adaptive, variable-bandwidth KDEs (LA-KDEs). We assess these metrics by applying them to 20 large synthetic data sets and one large empirical data set, and evaluate their utility in terms of sample similarity based on the following three criteria. (1) Similarity of samples from the same population should systematically increase with increasing sample size. (2) Metrics should maximize sensitivity by using the full range of possible coefficients. (3) Metrics should minimize artifacts resulting from sample-specific complexity. K-S and Kuiper test p-values passed only one criterion, indicating that they are poorly suited as quantitative descriptors of sample similarity. Likeness and Similarity coefficients of PDPs, as well as K-S and Kuiper test D and V values, performed better by passing two of the criteria. Cross-correlation of PDPs passed all three criteria. All coefficients calculated from KDEs and LA-KDEs failed at least two of the criteria.As hypothesis tests of derivation from a common source, individual K-S and Kuiper p-values too frequently reject the null hypothesis that samples come from a common source when they are identical. However, mean p-values calculated by repeated subsampling and comparison (minimum of 4 trials) consistently yield a binary discrimination of identical versus different source populations. Cross-correlation and Likeness of PDPs and Cross-correlation of KDEs yield the widest divergence in coefficients and thus a consistent discrimination between identical and different source populations, with Cross-correlation of PDPs requiring the smallest sample size. In light of this, we recommend acquisition of large detrital geochronology data sets for quantitative comparison. We also recommend repeated subsampling of detrital geochronology data sets and calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the comparison metric in order to capture the variability inherent in sampling a multimodal population.These statistical tools are implemented using DZstats, a MATLAB-based code that can be accessed via an executable file graphical user interface. It implements all of the statistical tests discussed in this paper, and exports the results both as spreadsheets and as graphic files.}},

	abstract = {The assembly and dispersion of continental crust are first-order controls on paleogeography and geochemical cycles. The associated reworking of Earth's crust can be tracked with zircon initial hafnium (εHfT) through space and time. Here we apply a new method of quantitative analysis using εHfT density estimates based on a compilation of 155,329 εHfT values. Investigation of the global database reveals significant geographic and temporal bias in the εHfT record associated with sampling and regional tectonic events. Recent research has attempted to address global εHfT bias using resampling methods to augment gaps of low εHfT data density, which in turn obfuscates tectonic signals and artificially weights outliers. Instead, we evaluate εHfT density patterns for both igneous and detrital zircon on eight continental zones demarcated by Paleozoic sutures: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Baltica, North America, Peri-Gondwana, and South America. Pairwise two-dimensional quantitative comparison highlights similarity in timing and εHfT values between zones, all of which can be linked to documented shared regional tectonism. Integration of all pairwise comparisons reveals that peak similarity corresponds to the timing of supercontinent amalgamation, and that the associated εHfT differs depending on the style of supercontinent amalgamation, particularly internal versus external orogenesis. The three most recent supercontinents produced distinctive εHfT signals, shared by the constituent continental zones. The supercontinents Rodinia and Pangea were constructed through collisions of marginal arc terranes, peripheral to ancient crust, and did not produce highly enriched εHfT values. In contrast, Ediacaran to Cambrian formation of the Gondwana supercontinent was largely the product of internal Pan-African orogens that formed directly after Neoproterozoic Rodinia rifting and arc accretion forming the Arabian Shield. The final assembly of Gondwana was dominated by continent-continent collisions of old radiogenic crust without establishment and accretion of extensive intervening depleted arc terranes, resulting in a more enriched distribution of εHfT values compared to prior and subsequent supercontinent formation. The secular εHfT record is the product of spatiotemporally biased sampling and preservation of specific orogenic belts with predictable εHfT data arrays, modulated by the amalgamation, tenure, and breakup of supercontinents through time.},

	abstract = {Recently, density peaks clustering (DPC) has received much attention. The key step in DPC is to find the nearest denser point (NDP) for each point. If a point and its NDP are close, they are in the same cluster; otherwise, they are in different clusters. However, the density gap between a point and its NDP is not considered in DPC. Once the point and its NDP are close, they are assigned to the same cluster, even if the density gap between them is large, which could result in poor clustering results. In this study, we propose a clustering algorithm based on finding prominent peaks (prominent peak clustering, PPC). Its main concept is to divide points into multiple potential clusters and then merge clusters whose density peaks are not prominent to obtain accurate clustering results. The prominence of cluster density peaks is measured by the density gap. Experimental results on low- and high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that PPC is competitive with other clustering techniques.},

	abstract = {Abstract Detrital geochronology provides insight into a broad range of Earth Science questions. However, detrital zircon U-Pb age distributions are inherently univariate, and thus quantitative comparison methods are limited to one-dimension (1D) and subject to nonunique results due to overlapping age groups. We developed two-dimensional (2D) quantitative comparison measures for bivariate kernel density estimates (KDEs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). These methods are extensions of 1D quantitative comparison measures commonly used in detrital geochronology: Similarity, Likeness, and Cross-correlation of KDEs and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and Kuiper tests of CDFs. We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods by applying them to a global compilation of detrital and igneous zircon univariate U-Pb data (n = 767,660) and bivariate U-Pb and Hf (i.e., εHfT) data (n = 114,311) parsed geographically into eight continental landmasses demarcated by Paleozoic sutures. The 2D quantitative comparison measures behave in a similar fashion to their 1D counterparts in terms of sensitivity and consistency regardless of parameterization (e.g., kernel bandwidth and discretization interval). Results show that the detrital record reliably reflects the igneous record for both univariate U-Pb and bivariate εHfT distributions between 4,400 and 0 Ma. In contrast, 1D and 2D quantitative comparison results differ over the narrower Ediacaran-Cambrian time interval due to nonunique univariate zircon U-Pb age groups; the 2D quantitative results consistently identify continental landmasses involved in the formation of Gondwana. We implemented the 2D methods in a new MATLAB-based graphical user interface, DZstats2D, which is available as open-source code and as standalone applications for macOS and Windows.},

	abstract = {Detrital thermochronology has been proposed as a method for measuring average basin-wide erosion rates. This paper illustrates how to use detrital apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology to map out where in a basin erosion takes place. Five samples of detrital AFT ages were collected on an alluvial fan that is fed by the Marble Creek drainage basin in the northern White Mountains (California). Using a digital elevation model (DEM) to characterize the basin hypsometry and a few published basement samples to constrain the age-elevation curve of the catchment, the detrital AFT distribution was predicted. Comparing the observed with the predicted age distributions reveals that localized rockfall events provide the sediment source of the currently active Marble Creek, but a composite sample from the entire alluvial fan indicates that, over longer time scales, the entire catchment contributes material to the debris-flow dominated fan, with more material being derived from lower elevations than from higher up the Marble Creek Canyon. The observed AFT age distribution is compared with the hypsometric predictions using the ``Cumulative Age Distribution'' (CAD) which is the cumulative distribution of the measured ages. In contrast with probability density estimators and their cumulative equivalents, the CAD requires no numerical smoothing while properly accounting for (unequal) measurement uncertainties.},

	abstract = {U-Pb ages of detrital zircons in clastic sediments are potential indicators of sedimentary provenance and crustal evolution. To extract geologically significant information from such data, it is necessary that the zircons analysed in the laboratory reflect the sediment from which they were separated. Among other factors, this depends on the number of grains analysed. The probability that a detrital zircon in a sediment belongs to one of several populations (defined by their age or another well-defined parameter) is described by the binomial probability formula, from which detection limits and expected values for the accuracy and precision of population sizes can be derived. Monte Carlo simulation of sets of data with up to 120 individual analyses drawn from pools with known age probability density distributions shows that quantitative representation of the age distribution of the zircons in the host sediment is unlikely to be achieved in natural cases. Methods that assume such representation (e.g., age spectrum deconvolution, multivariate statistical analysis using probability density scores, and mass balance modelling) are therefore likely to give results of questionable significance. The best way to extract the potential information contained in detrital zircons may be a combination of random and nonrandom selection of grains for analysis; yielding two complementary sets of age data from each sample, the random fraction should comprise 35-70 grains or more, depending on the complexity of the age distribution. The use of trace element and Lu-Hf isotope data from the zircons dated by U-Pb will give additional, valuable information, which may facilitate interpretation of detrital zircon ages. The use of detrital zircon ages to limit the age of deposition of the host sediment is fraught with both geological and statistical sources of error, and is therefore discouraged.},

	abstract = {While robust parameter estimation has been well studied in parametric density estimation, there has been little investigation into robust density estimation in the nonparametric setting. We present a robust version of the popular kernel density estimator (KDE). As with other estimators, a robust version of the KDE is useful since sample contamination is a common issue with datasets. What "robustness" means for a nonparametric density estimate is not straightforward and is a topic we explore in this paper. To construct a robust KDE we scale the traditional KDE and project it to its nearest weighted KDE in the L2 norm. This yields a scaled and projected KDE (SPKDE). Because the squared L2 norm penalizes point-wise errors superlinearly this causes the weighted KDE to allocate more weight to high density regions. We demonstrate the robustness of the SPKDE with numerical experiments and a consistency result which shows that asymptotically the SPKDE recovers the uncontaminated density under sufficient conditions on the contamination.},

	abstract = { Abstract Density estimation is a core operation of virtually all probabilistic learning methods (as opposed to discriminative methods). Approaches to density estimation can be divided into two principal classes, parametric methods, such as Bayesian networks, and nonparametric methods such as kernel density estimation and smoothing splines. While neither choice should be universally preferred for all situations, a well-known benefit of nonparametric methods is their ability to achieve estimation optimality for ANY input distribution as more data are observed, a property that no model with a parametric assumption can have, and one of great importance in exploratory data analysis and mining where the underlying distribution is decidedly unknown. To date, however, despite a wealth of advanced underlying statistical theory, the use of nonparametric methods has been limited by their computational intractibility for all but the smallest datasets. In this paper, we present an algorithm for kernel density estimation, the chief nonparametric approach, which is dramatically faster than previous algorithmic approaches in terms of both dataset size and dimensionality. Furthermore, the algorithm provides arbitrarily tight accuracy guarantees, provides anytime convergence, works for all common kernel choices, and requires no parameter tuning. The algorithm is an instance of a new principle of algorithm design: multi-recursion, or higher-order divide-and-conquer. },

	abstract = {This paper reviews the basic principles of radiometric geochronology as implemented in a new software package called IsoplotR, which was designed to be free, flexible and future-proof. IsoplotR is free because it is written in non-proprietary languages (R, Javascript and HTML) and is released under the GPL license. The program is flexible because its graphical user interface (GUI) is separated from the command line functionality, and because its code is completely open for inspection and modification. To increase future-proofness, the software is built on free and platform-independent foundations that adhere to international standards, have existed for several decades, and continue to grow in popularity. IsoplotR currently includes functions for U-Pb, Pb-Pb, 40Ar/39Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf, Re-Os, U-Th-He, fission track and U-series disequilibrium dating. It implements isochron regression in two and three dimensions, visualises multi-aliquot datasets as cumulative age distributions, kernel density estimates and radial plots, and calculates weighted mean ages using a modified Chauvenet outlier detection criterion that accounts for the analytical uncertainties in heteroscedastic datasets. Overdispersion of geochronological data with respect to these analytical uncertainties can be attributed to either a proportional underestimation of the analytical uncertainties, or to an additive geological scatter term. IsoplotR keeps track of error correlations of the isotopic ratio measurements within aliquots of the same samples. It uses a statistical framework that will allow it to handle error correlations between aliquots in the future. Other ongoing developments include the implementation of alternative user interfaces and the integration of IsoplotR with other data reduction software.},

@article{VERMEESCH2012190,
	abstract = {Since the development of SIMS and LA-ICP-MS technologies in the 1980s and 1990s, single grain U--Pb dating of detrital zircon has quickly become the most popular technique for sedimentary provenance studies. Currently by far the most widespread method for visualising detrital age distributions is the so-called Probability Density Plot (PDP), which is calculated by summing a number of Gaussian distributions whose means and standard deviations correspond to the individual ages and their respective analytical uncertainties. Unfortunately, the PDP lacks a firm theoretical basis and can produce counter-intuitive results when data quantity (number of analyses) and/or quality (precision) is high. As a more robust alternative to the PDP, this paper proposes a standard statistical technique called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), which also involves summing a set of Gaussian distributions, but does not explicitly take into account the analytical uncertainties. The Java-based DensityPlotter program (http://densityplotter.london-geochron.com) was developed with the aim to facilitate the adoption of KDE plots in the context of detrital geochronology.},

@article{TYE201967,
	abstract = {Populations of detrital zircons are shaped by geologic factors such as sediment transport, erosion mechanisms, and the zircon fertility of source areas. Zircon U-Pb age datasets are influenced both by these geologic factors and by the statistical effects of sampling. Such statistical effects introduce significant uncertainty into the inference of parent population age distributions from detrital zircon samples. This uncertainty must be accounted for in order to understand which features of sample age distributions are attributable to earth processes and which are sampling effects. Sampling effects are likely to be significant at a range of common detrital zircon sample sizes (particularly when n < 300). In order to more accurately account for the uncertainty in estimating parent population age distributions, we introduce a new method to infer probability model ensembles (PMEs) from detrital zircon samples. Each PME represents a set of the potential parent populations that are likely to have produced a given zircon age sample. PMEs form the basis of a new metric of correspondence between two detrital zircon samples, Bayesian Population Correlation (BPC), which is shown in a suite of numerical experiments to be unbiased with respect to sample size. BPC uncertainties can be directly estimated for a specific sample comparison, and BPC results conform to analytical predictions when comparing populations with known proportions of shared ages. We implement all of these features in a set of MATLAB{\textregistered} scripts made freely available as open-source code and as a standalone application. The robust uncertainties, lack of sample size bias, and predictability of BPC are desirable features that differentiate it from existing detrital zircon correspondence metrics. Additionally, analysis of other sample limited datasets with complex probability distributions may also benefit from our approach.},
